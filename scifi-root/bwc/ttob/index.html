This, this is the story of how I became a king. An emperor. Use the term you prefer, because to me it means nothing. I have everything, everywhere, yet I don't want any of that. I am the planet. Fused to this meat planet, controlling everything.
And now, I sit on my throne of bones, ruling over a kingdom of decay and death. My subjects are but mere bones, and the only sound that can be heard is the rattling of their skulls as they bow to me.
I am the ruler of nothingness, and yet, in this desolate and empty kingdom, I have found what I have always been searching for. Power. Control. Immortality.
This is the story of how I became the ultimate ruler. The one true king. The emperor of the bone throne. the emperor ON the throne of bones.
and how I plan to kill myself.
