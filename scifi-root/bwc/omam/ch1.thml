Chiara was walking down the hall.
the school hall was very busy, after all it was break time.
she was searching for a specific professor, to give him the papers she was holding.
there he was, inside a laboratory.
"Prof! here you are!" she hurried to him.
"Ohh, Chiara, whatch'a doing here?"
"the papers you asked me"
"'ight, thankyouverymucch" the man took the papers, and gave them a glance.
"all right, but first I have to do one thing.." the man started typing on a keyboard.
"can I go?"
"No, I have to ask you.. when did this activity took place?"
"uh, three days ago, I think.."
"four!"
A random student appeared from nowhere.
"oh, Daisuke, Hi! go away please, I don't have times for shenanigas"
Daisuke had a screwdriver in his hand.
"What's the matter?"
"it's serious, don't make me call Alcina."
"ugh fine" Daisuke exited the room.
"Hold on a second; you sure four days ago?"
"Yeah, I remember that because four days ago my toenails fell off, and it was during that activity."
"..gee, thanks."
The boy walked away.
"..who the hell?"
"I'ts Daisuke, you know him.."
"not really.."
"really? he's the special student from Nauzik Pharma"
"oh, the idiotic chaos?"
"yeah, him"
"he's.."
"yes"
"huh" Chiara went silent for a second.
"you can go now by the way"
Chiara exited the room, and went to her class.
there he was. Daisuke, the idiotic Chaos. His shenanigas and sheer power are known through all city.
She never saw his face, just his various forms. He was a normal student. almost anonymous.
"..."
The rest of the day went on slowly. Biology and Chemistry were boring today. She did not know why.
Though, she aced biology class with ease, and she liked the subject, this substitute teacher was quite boring to her.
"Minnie, do you know Daisuke?"
"oh yes, the crawling pervert! he's a doozy one haha"
the two girl started whispering to each other.
"he's not evil, just.. erratic, that's it"
"how come I never knew about him like this?"
"well you're from the southern cross right? that might explain it.."
"I knew about this kaijin who was an experiment of Nazumi Pharma-"
"Naizuk"
"..right, Naizuk. but I did not know he was a student.. a normal one!"
"the world is a strange place, what do you want me to tell you? our professor Perchipiatto was also a Kaijin and he was normal too.."
"normal? he smelled like rotting sheep"
"..."
"..."
The two girl giggled.
"what kind of name is Nauzik anyway?"
"Miss Chiara, you have something to share with us?" the Professor asked the girl.
"No no! I was asking her.. notes.."
"I have something to tell you tho" Daisuke was halfway through the door.
"And you are?"
"does not matter, is the snow white bike yours?"
"..yes?"
"nice bell!" he showed him a bike's bell.
"..wait, that' my-"
-DING-
"wrong answer!"
"Give it back!"
"Nah, I don't think I will"
Daisuke calmly went away.
"..he's.. he's bluffing right?" the teacher asked the class.
"I don't think so.."
"fuck" the professor gave him chase.
after some minutes Daisuke reappeared in the class
"Is he still after me?
..
alright cool, cool. I don't like him, his red shoes are.. clownish"
the class laughed.
"gotta buy a big red nose for him now,  that's a great idea" he dropped the bell, and went away.
the class laughed.
"See Chiara? that's Daisuke for you!" Minnie laughed.
Chiara laughed too, the whole thing was surreal.
when the professor entered the class again he had a big pair of fake mustaches.
"..he glued them to my lip." he said, angered yet defeated.
laughter ensued.
