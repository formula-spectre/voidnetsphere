<h1> preamble </h1>
<pre>
I am Aegis. I was human.
I am here to record everything that has happened in the reality that we live in.
you might recognize me as Military League's top dog, or as the Vision Runner.
I am long gone from the mortal realm, even the immortal realm, and I have transcended space and time, just like "Them", and now I exist everywhere and nowhere all at once.
the Heavy Industries use a shard of me inside a Winternet robot, but I still exist outside of that shell.
let me guide you through the myths and the legends on how reality itself was born, and what is the true meaning of "life".

before time began, there was the "Great Beyond". nothing existed, not time, not space. not life.
 then they came.
I will call them Architects.
Beings of immense power and wisdom. Their arrival in the Great Beyond marked the dawn of creation itself. Each Architect possessed their own unique essence, representing different aspects of existence.
