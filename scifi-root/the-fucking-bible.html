<pre>
in the beginning, there was the great beyond.
life, cells, time, space, gravity, nothing existed.
even the nothingness was not there, it was just an empty space, but even emptiness is something.
no, in this time there was the great beyond.
the great beyond was just a construct where "they" lived.
powerful things, going beyond the Homo Sapiens' ability to comprehend.
maybe in a thousand years, maybe never. maybe one day, but as of now, they are incomprehensible to us, so I won't spend too much time on them.
they were the master of the great beyond. Matter of fact, the great beyond was their construct.
everything was their construct. even themselves.
these omniscient beings then, decided to construct something we call "reality".
the "Why" and "How" is not for us to be known, but it had to do something with making energy and giving life.
and so reality was created. Finally, something tangible (to us) filled the great void.
from the very top edge of reality manifested one of these things: it manifested himself, and so, in a flash of light, particles were born.
we would call them God's particle from now on.
these god particle were the being, just shattered in an unthinkable number.
