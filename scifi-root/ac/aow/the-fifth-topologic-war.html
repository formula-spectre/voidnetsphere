<pre>
the sun was rising on the dry land of Taxaton.
the yellow light was lazily reaching over all territory.
it was quiet. only some native specie getting out to bask in the sun.
some scarabs, some lizards.
then, from the sky, fell a gigantic dark blue monolith.
it cracked the earth beneath him, and from the base, four feet dug themselves in the dirt.
then, it split in the middle; a white orb started glowing, and suddently, around the monolith, a circle of light extended to the sky.
from the circle of light started appearing troops; they had grey-ish armor, long rifles, and a retracted plasma shield.
the first five to come out had a red helmet with a long antenna on; they looked around, the started marching forward.
and then, from the light, more and more topologic warriors came. all with the same armor and weapons, but a grey helmet.
after a while they stopped exiting the beacon, but only to let more heavily armored ones get out; their armor was taller and bulkier, and one step was equal to two steps of the regular soldiers. they had weapons attached to their back; some had railguns, some flamethrowers, other plasma launchers; they also had weapons bolted to their wrists; menacing machine guns, or EMP generators.
then bigger robots, less humanoid, came out; bipedal, yes, but with a reverse knee; thick and bulky torso, and the head was on the front of it; two gigantic four fingered manipulators, and two more mechanical arm with clamps. these walking tanks were carrying heavier and bigger weapons; bigger plasma launchers, gigantic machineguns, and massive plasma bomb mortars.
more common infantry came out; for each 50 regular soldiers, 10 of those mechs came out.
quickly, an enormus amount of androids were marching forward, ready to battle any time.
they started spreading, and thus the battle began; in a saturation attack fashion they started running against the enemy, shooting every single one on sight.
the quietness of the place, before distrupted by the walking of the legions, now was completely destroyed by the noise of rifles shooting energy bolts, screams, and growls;
the enemy started attacking back; advancing against the robots, they started slashing, tearing and impale the robots.
every single warrior was shooting at every single of those red beasts; their shots made tentacles and meat fly off, but still they were advancing; soldiers with heavier weapons tried to assist by emitting conical plasma flames, in an attempt to melt their exteriors.
these nightmarish creatures, lovecraftian in nature, and industrialist in practice, yes, were phased by the sheer amount of warriors shooting and burning, but more and more were advancing; 
as the battle raged, the five red-helmet commanded realized one thing; they looked at the near mountains, and realized that they were not red due the light, but red because unthinkably numerous hordes of the enemey was running at full speed against them.
"this is not good!"
"we need more men! more fire power!"
"Vega! request for air support! 
"request granted. sending hovercrafts." a robotic voice echoed in the general's helmet.
"air support is not enough! Vega! bring the long range tanks!"
"request granted. sending long ranged electrical-type tanks."
from the beacon of light appeared gigantic tanks, taller more than 30 meters, with railungs no shorter than 50 meters. an entire battery was slowly advacing foward now, and they started launching blue bolts; the hissing of the charge was ear bleeding, and then, a gigantic "BAM" as the projectile exploded and left the railgun; these blue orbs of energy landed right in between the hordes of the enemy; as they landed on the floor, they create gigantic explosions of energy, destroying many enemies at once; but this is still, this was not enough; while these mighty explosions distrupted many hordes of foes, they were still too many; it was like two infinites armies clashing; for every death, 100 more troops take its place, on both sides.
this was not the beginning.
this became routine. this was has been raging for five years now.
the war was bloody. immeasurable losses on the side of humanity. many topologic android have fallen. many. just to inch ever so slightly closer to victory.
the line was stalemating. both sides could not advance.
"Here comes the air support!"
"warning: interplanetary bomb authorized." Vega broadcasted this message to every soldier.
"YES!" one of the general screamed in anticipation "COME ON, HIT THOSE BASTARDS!"
from the sky a gigantic beam shot down on the land, burning everything in a radius of 60 kilometers. then another,  and then another. gigantic black craters were left behind.
but this was still not enough. bigger and bigger foes were running head first to the troops.
A gigantic biomechanoid scolopendra-like monster rose from under the ground; it started blasting green rays from each leg, and eating everything it came close to.
many of those green rays were redirected against the gigantic foe. but now, two other, even longer, rose from under ground.
the tanks tried to shoot them down, and the more heavy armored troops tried to fly against them and cut off their limbs.
it was a slaughter; those rays could cut in half troops like a hot knife cuts butter.
but then, a ray of hope: six androids, with specialized purple armor and black gear descented from the sky: they had holographic orange green, and their armor was bulky yet sleek; they landed on the scolopendras, tearing a hole in them;
One lifted the scolopendra, and started swinging it around, for another one to shoot a gigantic green ray at it right in the head; slowly the hole created by the ray started expanding, consuming half of the idea; then another beam, and the scolopendra died.
these six android made quick work of those gigantic foes.
"Sigma Squad to every android that is still fighting: keep fighting, we have your back. FOR HUMANITY!"
a wave of screams, and then all soldiers became more furious; the flame of war was re-ignited, and now it was burning more intensly.
"Sigma Squad to Vega: requesting Sigma War titan."
"Request accepted. Beaming war Titan to your location."
"come on, let's kick some lovcraftian asses!"
"YES!"
the sigma squad advanced alongside the other troops; they helped them, and quickly went in the front.
a beam from the sky shot down on the ground; it created a big blue sphere, and from this sphere a gigantic purple mech emerged.
it was armed to the metaphorical teeth. he had two weapons on his shoulders; the got up, on a mechanical arm, and started shooting two continous green beams; everything that came in contact with it was annhilated, reduced to atoms;
"Sigma Squad to the five generals; advancing."
"copy that."
"Sigma squad: the Skulls are ready to be beamed." said vega to the six elites.
"beam them on the mountains."
"Position negated. can't make room for transport."
"then beam them to us!"
"Position valid. beaming Sigma Skulls squad."
eight beams, eight spheres, and eight new purple warriors appeared; as the name suggests, their helmet was skull shaped.
"Sigma Vanguard to Sigma Skulls: half of you provide long range support, half will carve a path foward."
"Copy that."
four Skulls took out their gigantic energy swords, and to the scream "FOR HUMANITY!" they charged with no fear into the horde of monsters.
"we must advance, we cannot lose this line."
the Sigma Vanguard started blasting, and slowly advanced; with them, the robot army advanced too.

    <i>Taxaton - 8th planet of the cluster Gemini, aligment Trantor.</i>
    <i>Planet UUID: 60dd900d-b5e8-4590-afa5-e335195c481c</i>

Taxaton, a gigantic planet, almost three times Earth, on the border of M51, commonly known as the vortex galaxy.
this curious planet has been in the center of attention as of lately.
the weather of this celestial body is quite bizzare: there is a clear split between hot and cold climate.
on the very top of the planet, there is a ring of heat; this is perpetually spinning, and causes boiling hot winds to blow; there is also a scorching light given by the near sun. the top side of the planet has no ozone layer; the solar rays fall on the naked soil, creating an infernal heat. Humankind managed to parry most of the radiations, but as not to alter the ecosystem, the extreme heat was kept. a thin layer of micro plastical veil surrounds the upper half of the planet. this absorbs the radiations, but lets the heat pass on the planet, along with UV-Rays and CV-Rays. the veil is so light that is kept in place by the planet's spinning, almost like space stations that float around planets.
the soil is orange. rocky. sterile. altough some plants managed to thrive here; cacti-like alien plants, that manage to create their own water resources by processing the CV Rays.
hot-blooded animals are also the residents of these vast canyons; most of them feature a thick boney skin, as to let the heat penetrate, but stop it after a while; their vasculatory system is designed so that it heats in certain parts, and transports the heat around the body. for example the Crocoxks; they're best described as bipedal terrestrial alligators, with scaly backs, and very thick and large nails; the scales on their back heat up, and special tissues transport the heat around the body.
their large teeth also serve as coolant, as they can open to expell excessive heat.
the sheer heat cannot be stressed enough; at best, 80 degrees celcius, at worst, 210 degrees. it's three times hotter than the hottest spot on earth.
on the other side of the planet, literally on the other side, it's freezing cold.
this lower half has a protective ozone layer, which does not let pass anything; rays, heat, light. well, light passes, but barely enough to give a perennal night feel. a night with no stars, or moon. a glacial winter night, that lasts forever.
here temperatures reach -300 degrees, and water is permafrosted even after 4 centimeters down.
here some life lives on the surface; fat and hairy Yeti-ish creatures, but most life form is fish-like, buried almost 30 kms under ice.
these fish creatures adapted special eyes, that does not see light, but dark; it works as the opposite of our eyes, they catch the absence of light; combined with reverse thermal vision, electromagnet sensors, and complex hearing sounds, they managed to live, find each other, and hunt.
their blood is quite peculiar; it's not a suspension, but rather, water with inside their cells; they use passive circulation to introduce water in their veins, so it will then transport around their cells, and this water goes a complex filtration mechanism, as to not lose any cell; it's then discarded.
many fish eat like this; they eat plankton and small life forms by drinking water, almost like whales.
this duality of weather is very bizzare, and harsh; but, it's not a perfect separation; there is an habitable strip on the middle of the planet. this makes the weather division not by two, but by three.
the habitable strip is way less than a third of the planet though. it's a 20% of the planet, while the two weathers are 40% each.
Yet, humanity has managed to live in here; it's almost like a permanent spring there, since it's the meeting point of hot and cold, and the two polar opposites right next to it allows humanity to grow a wide range of crops at the same time, that might require different weathers.
beets, broccoli, carrots could be grown at the same time of tomatoes, peppers and watermelons. just, one is on the south side of the strip, and the other on the north.
the peculiarity of this planet, aside of the bizzare weather separation, is also the fact that it's near a Paradox Anchor.
At first, the Anchor was not active, but, after a while when humanity settled there, it showed some activity. At first, it was nothing too disruptive; just sometimes in some points of the planet time would either accellerate, making everything in it age or grow faster, or time would stop at all in other zones; this was beneficial to the human that lived there, because they could bring dying patients in spots where time is immobile as to push back it's death, or they could cultivate crops in accellerated time zones, so they would have more food.
then, some more bizzare thing would happen; at first, it was small objects, live vases and pens would be warped into other positions or locations; a pen on a table would suddenly disappear and be on the floor, or on the roof; it was a mild annoyance sometimes, but it was still nothing too dangerous.
then, something more insidous started happening.
it was odd at first. some people would wake up with small punctures; they were three small red dots  in a triangle formation on their body; the most common points were the hands, right under the index knuckle, or on the neck, right on the jugular.
they were just red dots, doctors did not find anything out of the norm.
then something started happening to the "marked" ones.
they had multiple strokes. it was impossible, after at best the third stroke one should die, but even though they brain and heart was damaged they continued living.
it was bizzare, so these people were put under monitoring.
after some time, things got worse: their muscle tissues started converting into cardiac muscles; it was slow at first. from the area of the heart, the muscle slowly would convert into cardiac muscles, and expand from there.
and then, the 26 of August, one of these patient exploded.
Something was up.
the fact that this was happening in Amar, a city which, at the time of the exploding of the patient, was the closest to the Anchor Horizon of the nearby anomaly, made the Taxaton government call out for help to the Trantor Aligment.
Expert medics were sent, and a team of Paradox Observers was dispatched.

september 17, 342028 A.D.
"so.." two men, wearing blue jackets, were walking along a grey corridor.
"what do you think about the Marked ones?"
"either we found a new kind of disease, or the Paradox Anchor near this city is acting up. and I hope for the first one to be the one."
"yeah.."
they entered a room, with many screens and holograms around.
"anything new?"
"no, but the subspace around the Anchor is shifting around."
"show me."
The giant monitor showed the paradox anchor; around it there was a circle, holograms showed a globe with waves on it.
"sector 7 is anomalous."
"what do you mean? it's in the norm with other shifts."
"no, take a look at the values. the z axis fluctuates too much."
"what can you tell me about the Marked ones?"
"they did not explode, but they have started developing cancerous growth of cardiac muscles. they have full fledged but inactive hearts around their body, and many excessive cardiac tissue."
"did the Medical team figured out something?"
"not yet, they have been analyzing every single tissue produced, but it's regular, nothing out of the norm."
"we must prepare for the worst."
"Norman, what are you thinking?"
"give me the records of when patient 27 exploded."
"patient 27 exploded the 27 of august, this year-"
"time?"
"around 20:30."
"show me the subspace of the Anchor at that precise time."
The hologram refreshed; it was not that different from the previous projection.
"sector 7's Z-axis is not aligned!"
"very unanliged, it's -50."
"do you think this anomaly in this sector created the explosion?"
"I am starting to think so. but look at sector -7; it's also disaligned by +60."
"that is true.."
"what's the current status of the Anchor?"
"sector -7 is not acting up.."
"we have time then-"
"no wait! it just dropped: -90 on sector -7, and +60 in sector 6!"
"shit" the man grabbed a phone.
"Medical division? any update?"
the line was silent.
"shit."
Norman started running out of the room, but was held back by its companion.
"I'll go, it might be dangerous! it's my duty as a topological robot to protect you, human."
The android ran with great speed and energy.
on its way to the medical division, he grabbed a rifle; it was a big weapon, with cables connecting parts to the two big barrels.
the android rushed to the medical division.
he lifted the barrels, and suddenly they started glowing blue. Ready to fire at any time, he kicked the door open.
what was waiting behind the door was a mess of blood and flesh.
the patients were gone, and a gigantic mass of flesh was pulsating, almost breathing; blood vessels, hearts, lungs, teeth were everywhere.
"Karl to Norman. sending you my sight."
"..oh my god."
suddenly from the body of flesh a tendril made of cardiac muscle shooted forward to Karl.
He managed to deflect it with his gun, to then roll on his left, and start shooting.
his weapon was an heavy type, and the added stability of kneeling on one leg was helping.
"Karl here! I request backup; heavy artillery needed!"
blue rays were fired from the gun, and while the body of flesh got hole in them, it seems almost useless, from every wound more flesh would spurt out, like hot magma flowing out of a volcano.
the mass of flesh was visibly growing; first it was a quarter of the room, now the entire room was full of it; tendril would hang from the ceiling, with  three digits hands with sharp boney claw. they started contorting and stretching, reaching for Karl; he tried to shoot them down, but they started to crawl towards him; suddenly, their flesh tore open, and from there insect-like made from skin tissue and bones bursted out, while the tendril was contorting like crazy;
"WHAT THE-"
the wall behind Karl was busted down; a heavily armored Android destroyed the wall with his powered fist, and started shooting bullets like rain; he had two chainguns; one on his left shoulder and one strapped to his wrist.
"Karl! fall down!"
Karl rolled back, and assisted the giant humanoid tank.
"We need fire!"
"I got you!"
From the back of the armor a Rifle protuded out to Karl. He changed weapons, giving his rifle to his saviour; the rifle went under shoulder on the right of the Heavy armored android, and started shooting, while on his right shoulder a flamer protuded up, starting to spray flame spears left and right.
Karl made sure to do the same; he fiddled with his rifle, pulling back a red lever, then twisting it; now he was spraying fire in a conical fashion.
"What the fuck is this?"
"I don't know! just shoot everything!"
"Karl! Jan! fall back, i'm gonna use a hyperbomb!"
a third android, behind the two appeared, with a gigantic railgun. the two parts of the railgun split, making room for two spans at least; electricity started to dance in between these two as grey orb appeared from the back of the "mouth".
the two android launched themselves in opposite directions;
the third android launched the now green orb in the room; a gigantic explosion of plasma destroyed almost all of the flesh.
"Vega, push the altert; every patient under observation can be a danger, dispatch overwatch units."
"negative. not authorized to deploy active overwatch in this building.
...
Authorization granted by Captain. dispatching Overwatch."
After the dust settled the three androids slowly entered the room.
"you've got to be kidding me.."
some flesh survived: It jolted in the corner of the room, and, almost as if the sharp angle was a catalyst, it started spreading at neck-breaking speed.
now the corner was completely covered with a gigantic and pulsating elongated heart-like biomass.
it started spreading around the walls.
"Flamer weapons, quick!" the giant Destroyer changed the weapon strapped to his wrist.
Karl started spraying again flame like spears to the spreading mass.
From the corner a gigantic Tendril slowly sprouted out; it was like a starfish limb, but in a tiwsted and fleshy way. Under the muscles something was moving: the flesh tore apart, and skinned human creatures emerged, connected from the waist down to the giant tentancle.
"the fuck-" the Destroyer was slammed back by the giant tentancle. more skinned humans appeared, and from their mouth more tentacles sprouted out.
some detached, with no legs, or malformed ones.
"SHIT!"
Karl tuned his weapon again: now he was spraying a cone of plasma, burning everything in that radius. but it was not much.
"WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!"
"SHOOT AND THINK LATER!"
From the wall of flesh a grotesque human emerged; it had vestigial limbs fused all over,and his mouth was like a zip, protuding from his head to his left side of stomach.
It started walking toward the androids, in a disconnected and disjointed way.
"KARL!"
The android burned down that frightening foe
