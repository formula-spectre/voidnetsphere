the sun was rising on the dry land of Taxaton.
the yellow light was lazily reaching over all territory.
it was quiet. only some native specie getting out to bask in the sun.
some scarabs, some lizards.
then, from the sky, fell a gigantic blue monolith.
it cracked the earth beneath him, and from the base, four feet dug themselves in the dirt.
then, it split in the middle; a white orb started glowing, and suddently, around the monolith, a circle of light extended to the sky.
from the circle of light started appearing troops; they had grey-ish armor, long rifles, and a retracted plasma shield.
the first five to come out had a red helmet with a long antenna on; they looked around, the started marching forward.
and them, from the light, more and more topologic warriors came. all with the same armor and weapons, but a grey helmet.
after a while they stopped exiting the beacon, but only to let more heavily armored ones get out; their armor was taller and bulkier, and one step was equal to two steps of the regular soldiers. they had weapons attached to their back; some had railguns, some flamethrowers, other plasma launchers; they also had weapons bolted to their wrists; menacing machine guns, or EMP generators.
the bigger robots came out; they were less humanoid; bipedal yes, but with a reverse knee; thick and bulky torso, and the head was on the front of it; two gigantic four fingered manipulators, and two more mechanical arm with clamps. these walking tanks were carrying heavier and bigger weapons; bigger plasma launchers, gigantic machineguns, and massive plasma bomb mortars.
more common infantry came out; for each 50 regular soldiers, 10 of those mechs came out.
quickly, an enormus amount of robots were marching forward, ready to battle any time.
they started spreading, and thus the battle began; in a saturation attack fashion they started running against the enemy, shooting every single one on sight.
the quietness of the place, before distrupted by the walking of the legions, now was completely destroyed by the noise of rifles shooting energy bolts, screams, and growls;
the enemy started attacking back; advancing against the robots, they started slashing, tearing and impale the robots.
every single warrior was shooting at every single of those red beasts; their shots made tentacles and meat fly off, but still they were advancing; soldiers with heavier weapons tried to assist by emitting conical plasma flames, in an attempt to melt their exteriors.
these nightmarish creatures, lovecraftian in nature, and industrialist in practice, yes, were phased by the sheer amount of warriors shooting and burning, but more and more were advancing; 
as the battle raged, the five red-helmet commanded realized one thing; they looked at the near mountains, and realized that they were not red due the light, but red because unthinkably numerous hordes of the enemey was running at full speed against them.
"this is not good!"
"we need more men! more fire power!"
"Vega! request for air support! 
"request granted. sending hovercrafts." a robotic voice echoed in the general's helmet.
"air support is not enough! Vega! bring the long range tanks!"
"request granted. sending long ranged electrical-type tanks."
from the beacon of light appeared gigantic tanks, taller more than 30 meters, with railungs no shorter than 50 meters. an entire battery was slowly advacing foward now, and they started launching blue bolts; the hissing of the charge was ear bleeding, but then, a gigantic "BAM" as the projectile exploded and left the railgun; these blue orbs of energy landed right in between the hordes of the enemy; as
