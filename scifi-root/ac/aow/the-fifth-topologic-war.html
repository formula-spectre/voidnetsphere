<pre>
the sun was rising on the dry land of Taxaton.
the yellow light was lazily reaching over all territory.
it was quiet. only some native specie getting out to bask in the sun.
some scarabs, some lizards.
then, from the sky, fell a gigantic blue monolith.
it cracked the earth beneath him, and from the base, four feet dug themselves in the dirt.
then, it split in the middle; a white orb started glowing, and suddently, around the monolith, a circle of light extended to the sky.
from the circle of light started appearing troops; they had grey-ish armor, long rifles, and a retracted plasma shield.
the first five to come out had a red helmet with a long antenna on; they looked around, the started marching forward.
and them, from the light, more and more topologic warriors came. all with the same armor and weapons, but a grey helmet.
after a while they stopped exiting the beacon, but only to let more heavily armored ones get out; their armor was taller and bulkier, and one step was equal to two steps of the regular soldiers. they had weapons attached to their back; some had railguns, some flamethrowers, other plasma launchers; they also had weapons bolted to their wrists; menacing machine guns, or EMP generators.
the bigger robots came out; they were less humanoid; bipedal yes, but with a reverse knee; thick and bulky torso, and the head was on the front of it; two gigantic four fingered manipulators, and two more mechanical arm with clamps. these walking tanks were carrying heavier and bigger weapons; bigger plasma launchers, gigantic machineguns, and massive plasma bomb mortars.
more common infantry came out; for each 50 regular soldiers, 10 of those mechs came out.
quickly, an enormus amount of robots were marching forward, ready to battle any time.
they started spreading, and thus the battle began; in a saturation attack fashion they started running against the enemy, shooting every single one on sight.
the quietness of the place, before distrupted by the walking of the legions, now was completely destroyed by the noise of rifles shooting energy bolts, screams, and growls;
the enemy started attacking back; advancing against the robots, they started slashing, tearing and impale the robots.
every single warrior was shooting at every single of those red beasts; their shots made tentacles and meat fly off, but still they were advancing; soldiers with heavier weapons tried to assist by emitting conical plasma flames, in an attempt to melt their exteriors.
these nightmarish creatures, lovecraftian in nature, and industrialist in practice, yes, were phased by the sheer amount of warriors shooting and burning, but more and more were advancing; 
as the battle raged, the five red-helmet commanded realized one thing; they looked at the near mountains, and realized that they were not red due the light, but red because unthinkably numerous hordes of the enemey was running at full speed against them.
"this is not good!"
"we need more men! more fire power!"
"Vega! request for air support! 
"request granted. sending hovercrafts." a robotic voice echoed in the general's helmet.
"air support is not enough! Vega! bring the long range tanks!"
"request granted. sending long ranged electrical-type tanks."
from the beacon of light appeared gigantic tanks, taller more than 30 meters, with railungs no shorter than 50 meters. an entire battery was slowly advacing foward now, and they started launching blue bolts; the hissing of the charge was ear bleeding, and then, a gigantic "BAM" as the projectile exploded and left the railgun; these blue orbs of energy landed right in between the hordes of the enemy; as they landed on the floor, they create gigantic explosions of energy, destroying many enemies at once; but this is still, this was not enough; while these mighty explosions distrupted many hordes of foes, they were still too many; it was like two infinites armies clashing; for every death, 100 more troops take its place, on both sides.
this was not the beginning.
this became routine. this was has been raging for five years now.
the war was bloody. immeasurable losses on the side of humanity. many topologic android have fallen. many. just to inch ever so slightly closer to victory.
the line was stalemating. both sides could not advance.
"Here comes the air support!"
"warning: interplanetary bomb authorized." Vega broadcasted this message to every soldier.
"YES!" one of the general screamed in anticipation "COME ON, HIT THOSE BASTARDS!"
from the sky a gigantic beam shot down on the land, burning everything in a radius of 60 kilometers. then another,  and then another. gigantic black craters were left behind.
but this was still not enough. bigger and bigger foes were running head first to the troops.
A gigantic biomechanoid scolopendra-like monster rose from under the ground; it started blasting green rays from each leg, and eating everything it came close to.
many of those green rays were redirected against the gigantic foe. but now, two other, even longer, rose from under ground.
the tanks tried to shoot them down, and the more heavy armored troops tried to fly against them and cut off their limbs.
it was a slaughter; those rays could cut in half troops like a hot knife cuts butter.
but then, a ray of hope: six androids, with specialized purple armor and black gear descented from the sky: they had holographic orange green, and their armor was bulky yet sleek; they landed on the scolopendras, tearing a hole in them;
One lifted the scolopendra, and started swinging it around, for another one to shoot a gigantic green ray at it right in the head; slowly the hole created by the ray started expanding, consuming half of the idea; then another beam, and the scolopendra died.
these six android made quick work of those gigantic foes.
"Sigma Squad to every android that is still fighting: keep fighting, we have your back. FOR HUMANITY!"
a wave of screams, and then all soldiers became more furious; the flame of war was re-ignited, and now it was burning more intensly.
"Sigma Squad to Vega: requesting Sigma War titan."
"Request accepted. Beaming war Titan to your location."
"come on, let's kick some lovcraftian asses!"
"YES!"
the sigma squad advanced alongside the other troops; they helped them, and quickly went in the front.
a beam from the sky shot down on the ground; it created a big blue sphere, and from this sphere a gigantic purple mech emerged.
it was armed to the metaphorical teeth. he had two weapons on his shoulders; the got up, on a mechanical arm, and started shooting two continous green beams; everything that came in contact with it was annhilated, reduced to atoms;
"Sigma Squad to the five generals; advancing."
"copy that."
"Sigma squad: the Skulls are ready to be beamed." said vega to the six elites.
"beam them on the mountains."
"Position negated. can't make room for transport."
"then beam them to us!"
"Position valid. beaming Sigma Skulls squad."
eight beams, eight spheres, and eight new purple warriors appeared; as the name suggests, their helmet was skull shaped.
"Sigma Vanguard to Sigma Skulls: half of you provide long range support, half will carve a path foward."
"Copy that."
four Skulls took out their gigantic energy swords, and to the scream "FOR HUMANITY!" they charged with no fear into the horde of monsters.
"we must advance, we cannot lose this line."
the Sigma Vanguard started blasting, and slowly advanced; with them, the robot army advanced too.
