VEGA system
the vega is the main uplink for all types of topological androids; it's basically a gigantic central server that coordinates the androids in battle, or when something big needs coordination.
the VEGA grand-macro hypercomputer is a gigantic industrial-planet like construction; at it's core it's a dyson sphere, but on the surface, instead of a factory, it's a massive composite matrioska hypercomputer;
it's divided into four major section, and around 250 minor section per major section. the computational power serves the vega server, which almost all topological technology can connect to.

the server has a zettascale power of 5x10^4800 numaflops. All topologic technologies after second generation can have a vega subsystem; there is hybridware device that can be plugged in sector 6 of the Auxiliary Spinal Ports.
installing this physical module allows hammered waves transmission to and from vega. the android itself or someone else decides if vega can override or not the will of the android. the software part is a Pluggable Software Subsystem, which requires only on the standard tkShell to metacompile itself into the android. once connected the android creates an endpoint, which is a FIFO socket;
altho some android model require a broker service due incompability with main bus. A common misconception is that VEGA beams equipment to androids during war/when needed; that is not the case, it simply sends a signal to a nearby beacon-type object, which then sends material to the requester. if you were wondering, the VEGA name cames from the star itself, where the core is, but it was backronym'ed into meaning "VEGA Ensures Good Assistance"
[note]: 1 numaflop =  10^100^100^100, if this is too overkill let me know
