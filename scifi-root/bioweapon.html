<h3 id="description">Description:</h3>
<p>the “Gauna” (Quintaxjan for “Strangely created Creature -
Ga-au-Nahji”) Project consists in a Main alive component, Called Gauna-0,
and Sub-species created by it.</p>
<p>Gauna-0 is a creature, Biomechanical-type [1], Composed principally
by one head, four arms, a tail, and tentacles. due to the unstable dna,
Gauna-0 must be contained in a level 5 cryogenic pod, with resctriction
of two atheros-6 chain per limb. the Tentacles, if not too big, can be
restricted with a atheros-2 chain per extension. This report is gonna
focus mainly on Gauna-0, to see the derivations, consult the adjacent
database.</p>
<h4 id="physical-description">Phisical Description</h4>
<p>Gauna-0’s Head does not feature any visible visual organ. the upper
part of the head is enclosed in a translucent dome, with approximately 2
organs. one of which is a giant compounded structure, that reflects
photons, infra-red rays and UV rays. So to speak it can be considered a
giant eye of class 4. the second organ is another compounded one, this
time two cavities folded on themselves multiple times, with pheromone
receptors inside. The only visible feature on Gauna-0’s head is the
mouth, with approximately 40 teeth, 20 upper and 20 lower. These teeth
seem to be divided in various categories, to facilitate the breaking and
chewing of virtually every material, including, but not restricted to: -
Plant-based material - Flesh-based material - alcaline/ferrous material
- biomechanical material</p>
<p>A tongue is also present, but the main scope is to stab enemies and
inject a dose of a poisonius liquid, stored in two glands inside the
lower part of the jaw. the head of Gauna-0 is fused to the neck, yet it
is able tilt the head around, with around a 280 degree angle. Gauna-0’s
Arms are different from each other, due to the unstable nature of the
project [2], but after observation a pattern emerged:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A more developed one, complete with mucles, claws, and
metal-plating; this one has the bicep an trycep muscle exposed, to give
more expansion room while flexing, although it seems that most of the
time they’re covered with a thick membrane made of collagen and wires.
The entirety of this arm is biomechanical. each muscles has a spine
running down it, this is partially why the bicep and trycep are
semi-exposed. observation has noted that these two muscles’ spines tend
to expand more, expecially during running or lifting. the skin is a
thick and flexible material. upon analysis it seems to be small overlaid
tungsten plating suspended in a type #5000 skin. more observation needs
to be taken, since this tungsten skin was an irregular trait that now
seems to have become regular occurance in Gauna-0’s mutation. the claws
and bone plating are different than the plating on the skin, since
they’re made of the previous non tungsten bone. these are fully organic
material. the claws seems to be biomechanoid mass folded on itself
various times, with many breaking point so to quickly lose a dull claw
and replace it by pushing a new one out. more observation is
needed.</p></li>
<li><p>a less developed one, with a five-digit hand, complete with
nails. the Bicep and Trycep are biomechanoid, with similar traits to the
Hujitas (see: Project #6584653429 - <em>Quintaxja</em> ). these muscles
are powerful, but they do not have protection. This arm is covered in a
thick skin, which does not cover the two previously mentioned muscles.
to be noted is that the nails seem to have grown from inside the skin,
tearing it when developed. The skin and other muscles seems not to be
biomechanical, unlike the afformentionted trycep and bicep. While this
might lead to believe to an imbalance, the organic muscle are able to
develop an extraordinary amount of force, due the density of muscle
fiber. OBSERVATION 2022: recently Gauna-0’s organic muscle fiber has
been replaced with folded biomass fibers. more observation is
needed.</p></li>
<li><p>a very muscular one, with no skin, but a giant clawed hand, with
each claw being approximately 30 cm. this one has the most developed
deltoid of the four, and it’s the most inconsisent one: The upper arm
seems to be biomechanical, while the lower arm seems to be folded
biomass, but fibers of both kind keep shifting around the whole arm,
mixing the type of muscle and creating an insconsisent muscle structure.
Another bizzare trait is the presence of bone spikes, but these are
believed to be a result of the muscle fiber snapping the structural
bones, and them growing out due misalignment.</p></li>
<li><p>The fourth arm is the most cosistent biologically, but incosisent
in appearence: it mostly appears as the thin and wide, covered in
traslucent skin, with a single hand whose digit range from 5 to 10. it
seem that this arm can stretch to an extend, and it’s composed by folded
biomechanical fibers interlaced with both collagen and normal biological
muscle fibers. SPECIAL PROCEDURE: If more than 10 digits grow onto the
hand structure, the extra digit shall be removed. the excess biomass can
either be fed back to Gauna-0, or taken into the laboratory to further
analyze it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Gauna-0’s Legs are mostly defined by the large biomechanoid tryceps
and a platigrade structure. It has been observed that the skin on the
legs is very fragile in some areas; if Gauna-0 is subjected to running
at a speed that is superior to 50 Km/h, the skin covering the quadriceps
will rip, exposing the muscle and the spine; this is due the spine of
the muscle expanding to accomodate the stress put on the muscle. to be
noted: most of the times the legs sports a metal-like plating
protection, but it’s unknow why this trait is inconsistent. A possible
theory is that this type of protection is too heavy on the legs, but why
a metal-like material instead of bones in unknow. further investigation
and observation needed</p>
<p>Gauna-0’s torso spots many ribs, conjoined to a sternum. the number
of the ribs is inconsistent, but the sternum can be either one or two.
The lower part of Gauna-0 is mostly uncovered, exposing two large
biomechanical muscles overlapped; each starts from one leg and ends on
the opposite side of the rib cage. these two muscles have been observed
in the past to have a bone plating, then a gel like covering. As of the
writing of this document, these two muscles are a new kind of
biomechanical muscle: They fuse the accordion-like structure and
spine-based structure of type #0010 and #0001 biomechanical muscle. this
new type of muscle, labelled type #0120, when injured regrows at an
almost cancerous rate, doubling the size of the entire muscle.

<p>Gauna-0 cryo-pod is the number 000000122. it must be kept at a sub
zero temperature, with range varying to -20 under zero and -10. failure
to contain the entity this way might result in neural activtiy and
reaction to external stimuli, which can lead to contamination if a
breach happens. if such thing happens, use cryogenic equipement, with
the objective to freeze the entity at a temperature somewhere between
-272 and -500. Gauna-0 will then be thaw in cryo-pod no. 000000122, not
before securing him in place with atheros-10 Chain per limb. after the
neural activity has been restored to usual contaiment values, the
atheros chain described in this document shall be used.</p>
