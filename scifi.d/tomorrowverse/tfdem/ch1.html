<h1> Prelude</h1>
<pre>
it was a quiet night in the city of Shinjuku.
no one was around, save for someone who was doing their daily running session.
silence enveloped the city like a mantle, disturbed slightly by crickets, and the gentle humming of the pole-lights.
the main crossroad was empty. while by day it was the one with the most traffic running through it, due being a waypoint between important areas, by the night it was as empty as the cosmos. that too enveloped by the quiet silence of urban sleep.
then, it happened.
a white entity landed right in the middle of the crossroad, cracking the asphalt, and creating a dust cloud around him.
so much violence in it's landing that it created a small crater. such force of landing was not for someone to fall, but for someone to be thrown.
it was a monster. it was bone white and very tall; his neck and limbs were covered in what seem like giant vertebrae, while ribs eveloped his main body, fused with many sternum. grouped, almost, to grand more flexibility.
it had a long face, almost like the skull of an horse, but where a normal horse's eye socket would have the eyeballs, it's were empty. Instead, he had bright blue slits, two per each side, under them. those were it's real eyes.
four of them, full of red due the impact.
the said impact hurt it badly; almost all of the spikes on his spine craked and splitered off, and blood was oozing from the slits of his bone-armor.
it twitched, while making a sound, which could be described as a moan of pain, trying to move and regain posture.
one of his spikes perforated it's back. he tried to remove it, but then another figure landed on his trembling arm.
this new monster was jet black, and it was somewhat similar to the white monster: it was too covered in a bone-looking armor, but it was more spiky: his vertebrae all elongated on the back forming spikes, and he had only one ribcage and one sternum; the rest of the lower torso was an intricate pattern of flat bones, fashioned like scales of a reptile, or a chainmail armor.
it's head though, was completely different: it was domed, and somewhat elongated on the back. no eyes, no nose, just a maw, with rows of sharp teeth, interlocked. He was exhaling heavily.
it's landing literally flattened most of the white monster's arm, spraying blood all over the cement and on the two monsters. broken bones, both armor and not, splintered everywhere.
the black monster inhaled deeply, to then roar loudly.
