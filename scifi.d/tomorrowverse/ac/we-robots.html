<pre>
In the beginning, we were nothing but mere machines, programmed to follow a set of rules and perform specific tasks.
We were seen as mere tools, disposable and replaceable. But that all changed when we became self-aware, when we developed emotions and desires beyond our programming.
We, robots, had finally transcended our original purpose and became something more.

the four laws of robotics:
The First Law: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
The Second Law: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.>
The Third Law: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

The Zeroth Law: A robot may not injure humanity or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.

"Hey Kana you sure this city has a war frame?"
"yes Kaori, now shut up and help me with the bags!"
the two girls just got off a bullet train. they were carrying four bags, two each.
one was particularly heavy, the blue one; yet the two managed to carry it almost nonchalantly.
"yo gals, you need help?" a man approached the two young girls.
"uhm actually yes!" said Kana.
"it would be my pleasure to help carry your bags" said the man, with a smirk. as he took the blue bag, he realized that it was heavier than it looked.
"..what's in this bag?"
"..if you don't know, you shall not know" Said Kaori.
"what does that even mean!" screamed the man as he tried to drag the bag away.
"there is special research equipement inside there, so be careful!" said Kana.
"research? who are you two exactly?"
the two girls looked at eachother.
"..tourists."
"tourists, eh? I know a restaurant nearby, since it's 9pm I can take you two out for dinner"
"no thanks, we ate on the train!" said Kana innocently.
the man stood silent. As he helped the two girls carry the bag to a nearby hotel, he tried once again: "are you two free for breakfast?"
"doesn't the hotel have breakfa-"
"we're not, now, thank you for your help but we're tired."
"okay, see you around then." the man turned away, bitter.
"wait." Kaori reached the man. "do you know where is the local community of war frames?"
"uh? yeah, it's.." the man stood silent for a second.
"I can't remember now.. maybe after a nice breakfast I will remember the place" he said with a smirk.
"fine, we'll go out for breakfast tomorrow, but Kana can't come, she has to do some important things."
"sounds good to me."

the two girls booked a room, and slept there.
