Earth, once a majestic blue jewel that had kindled humanity's dreams and aspirations, lay shattered and desolate. It was no longer adorned in the radiant blue hues that had once adorned it like a precious sapphire; instead, it wore a bleak, mottled coat of brown and red. Its lush green forests and bountiful nature had been torn asunder by the relentless storm of war.

The waters, which had once flowed with crystalline purity, mirrored the Earth's suffering. The massive oceans, once teeming with life and vitality, had become a poisoned abyss, their serene blue depths turned to murky brown and green. Toxic waste and the scourge of warfare had extinguished life within their depths. Only the hardiest, the most resilient survivors, persisted in the face of the relentless onslaught of the new world's toxicity.

The war, a relentless and unforgiving tempest, continued to ravage the Earth's surface. From orbit, it was an apocalyptic canvas, marked by the stark white streaks of lethal energy beams crisscrossing the globe. Countless warring factions clashed in battles that left scars upon the wounded world.

Then, in the midst of the chaos, came a blinding flash of light from the northern pole, a beacon of incandescent brilliance that pierced the heavens. It seemed brighter than the very sun that the beleaguered planet still orbited. Simultaneously, a second beam erupted from the southern pole, radiating in the opposite direction. These colossal rays of energy appeared to transfix Earth, as if a colossal white spear had been thrust through the heart of the planet itself.

But it was a brief moment of illumination. Earth convulsed, its surface now a molten sea of crimson. Then, in an apocalyptic crescendo, it burst asunder, a cataclysmic explosion that shattered not only Earth but also its silent companion, the Moon, a testament to the relentless brutality of the prolonged conflict.
Million of lives lost, in a blink of an eye.

This is a tale of the Hypermarine incident, and how it inflicted a scar in humanity.. no, the universe's history.
