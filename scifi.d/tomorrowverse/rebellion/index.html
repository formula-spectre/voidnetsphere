William opened his eyes.
Everything was blurry and sounds were muffled.
then, in an instant, reality shifted into focus.
there was a constant noise. an horrible "Beep".
it was his alarm clock.
without moving his focus from the ceiling he reached for button and the sound went away.
The ceiling was grey.
the only light was warm, and powerful enough to illuminate the room.
yet, the ceiling was still grey.
He got up.
he stood there, on his bed for a solid minute, before removing the sheets and getting away from his bedroom.
"What day is today?"
"doesn't matter, it's a work day"
these were it's only two thoughts.
He went to the kitchen. the Coffee machine had a bright red text saying "GOOD MORNING - READY".
He pressed a button.
clancking, sounds of boiling water, then came out a perfectly black coffee, in a mug.
everything was automated and optimized to the point that it was ready in 3 seconds.
William took the coffee mug.
Today he felt strange. he did not sat down as usual and eat something, but instead he leaned against the window of the kitchen.
A thousand yard stare showed him a dark and starry void of blackness.
while a stare on what was actually there. a city. A grey city. with buildings as high as they could get.
it was not a city. it was an industrial complex disguised as a city.
everyone in this sector.. no.
everyone on The Nexus worked for them.
Everything changed when They arrived.
