                    If you think about it, Disney's animated films have always had one overriding message.
                    Clap your hands and believe hard enough, and Tinkerbell will live. When you wish upon a star... anything your heart desires... <br>

                    People like to say Disney has some connection to Satanism, but I never bought into that. I still don't. I think they've been trying to create that Golden Calf... a God-Idol that everyone believes in... one that everyone loves... It's almost as if any dream or idea that is shared by enough human hearts and minds has a real chance of being born into the world.

Kaijins, half human half gaunas.
Gaunas, Alien horrific beasts straight out of a lovecraft book or a croenenberg film.</i>

<hr>
It was night. a strange hooded figure was standing on top of a house. he was checking some kind of hologram, projected by his bracelet.
He swiftly jumped on another roof. checked again hologram.
he was enveloped in a black robe, which exposed only his legs.
he had a sleek power armor, with extra movement gear on the side of his lower legs. it was midnight blue, and the thrusters were slowly pulsating a tame and low green.
after two more jumps he was now grabbing a water pipe; one of his hands firmly grasping the surface, while only one leg was making contact with the said tube. he bent his knees, almost to prepare to jump again.
he was looking at a group of five people, who were excanging money.
without hesitation he bolted down, like a projectile, and getting rid of his robe; Now fully revealed, his hands grabbed a rectangular blade on his back, and, like a hot knife with butter, he crashed down on an individual of the group, cutting his right arm off cleanly.
there was no spray of blood. just everyone jumped back screaming.
the target put a hand on his shoulder, where the arm should've been.
"YOU!"
"Dirty Kaijins, you won't escape me." said the individual.
his face was covered partially; he had a green visor and a gear that was similar to a gas mask, but with no filter nor reservoir. just two grills, one per side.
he bolted again, cutting clean in half another of the man, as they scramble to reply to his attack; his green blade cut off a tentancle that was sprouting off one of the men.
"You are the Slayer!"
"Correct."
He kicked the man away, as now his focus was on the three now transformed kaijins. their tentancles resembled starfishes' appendices.
The slayer grasped his blade with both hands.
"tell me where are your kind, bone freak"
"Why should I?" he shot sharp bone darts to the slayer, before falling back.
"We have names you know" said the other one dashing foward alongside the darts.
The Slayer dodged the darts, and was squaring off the kaijin. he cut off one of his tentacles.
"you don't need names, you're filthy scum"
as he cut the tentancle, the kaijin fell back.
"Well, I'm hydra and-"
"Hydra, it's no use, remember what Rex said"
"huh?"
Hydra tried to regrow his tentancle, but it was useless.
"YOU!"
"Correct." The slayer took a small pistol, and shot "Hydra".
suddenly, a gigantic surge of electricity went through the Kaijin's body, paralyzing him, and making his eyeballs explode.
"Hydra!"
"You're next." The Slayer was approaching with his blade to the kaijin with the bone exoskeleton.
"your friend ran away. you ally is paraplegic now, either you speak or you die."
"Fuck you. they did not run away, they went calling the Owl."
"Good, more blood."
The two figure stood still for a second.
The kaijin tried to quickly jump away, but the Slayer was faster: a sonic boom preceded the slayer dashing forward with his blade, impaling the monster to a wall, with the blade breaking the sternum and skewering him.
He coughed blood.
"now tell me where are the other bone freaks."
"Never."
The slayer tore off bare handed his right arm.
"Last chance before I blow your brain out." He pulled out a plasma shotgun. He charged it, the pointed it right on his face, not even with a distance, straight up barrel to the face.
"Go on. You cannot stop us. The Plague lord is soon to be-"
BLAM.
blood, flesh, bones, and brain splattered in a semi circle on the wall.
"bullshit, there is no plague lord." he said.
He took the blade off the body. the blood on it evaporated quickly, leavy only some stains, which slowly fell off.
"although.. the Vomit God.." the Slayer was linking what this Kaijin said with what another one said.
"I better get out of here. Owls are too much of an hassle, and I wont get anything from them anyway."
another sonic boom, and he disappeared in the night, leaving a small crater behind.
