I was on my self-discovering journey after the Carmilla incident.
a self exile if you will.
I still had too many questions and too many conflicting emotions to process. so I disappeared again.
the monotone grey of every single thing was comforting.
and the fight against rogue androids from time to time reminded me that I was still alive and not dead from hunger, thirst, or backstabbed by some androids.
then I felt a strange sensation. at first I shrugged it off.
this burden I carry gives me great powers, but at the same time touches my soul, if I still have one, in strange ways.
but that feeling started to become a regularity. something scraping at the back of my skull each day. each minute.
each day it become more intrusive.
then each minute it became more intrusive.
then, I realized something was wrong. not with me, not with it, but with the megastructure itself.
has the Total State Machine reawekened?
no. this was something more powerful than a mere crazy corrupted artficial intelligence.
then it happened.
I woke up from a nap, with a feeling of urgency.
darkness was closing in at a rapid pace. strange winds were blowing in every direction.
I struggled to keep standing, so I planted my sword, and tried to resist.
the darkness approached everything.
it was not regular darkness. it was.. advanced darkness?
it's hard to describe. it almost seem like everything the darkness eveloped got.. erased. destroyed. cancelled.
removed from existence.
the darkness was all around me, devouring the concrete of the megastructure and some rogue androids.
then it started eveloping me.
if what it did to concrete was anything to go by, then this will finally be my end.
yet..
I was floating in darkness.
my sword was acting strange. almost like it was reacting with the darkness.
I don't know how much time has passed since I started floating in the void.
for some reason my sword was protecting me from being consumed by the darkness.

I floated in pure blackness for what seemed like an eternity.
at least it gave me time to think.
then I saw it.
a small light.
my sword reacted.
I started "swimming" to that small white dot.
the more I got close, the more my sword was reacting more strangely.
then, when it seemed like I was close to reaching that light, my sword opened, and I was enveloped in the light.




I woke up in a field of grass.
