<i>I never wanted this.
you showed me the light in my darkest hour.
you were the light that casted away the darkest shadows.
I freed myself of everything that I was just to become your pupil then your personal guard. </i>

Kuroto was standing in front of a wood elves camp, with two eldritch flamers.

<i> but the brighest star casts the darkest shadow. </i>

Hhe was wearing a twisted parody of the armor that he wore as the High Priestess' personal bodyguard, but instead of being beige, almost bone white, it was deep black, with only shimmers of purple, giving the impression that it was made of obsidian.
His two massive claws spread wide open, almost like he was stretching his hands, as if that movement was a trigger, the two eldritch flamers slid from his forearms; their mouth opened, and they positioned themselves under his forearms, sliding on the various panels of his armor with a quiet wirr.
he close his claws in two giant fists.
He started the two forbidden weapons: tubes, almost like tentacles, emerged from his back, to link the two firearms to his backpack.
His visor slit up to mask his face, leaving only a mask with vent grills on the "mouth" and one red slit as a visor, with three red circular sensor on the forehead.
The mouth of the two flamers sparkled with some lighthings, then a small flame of blue fire came alive, one per weapon.
paradoxically, as they ignited, the air around the flames became colder.

<i>But you betrayed me. you gave me false hope of a bright future.</i>

He started advancing. the sound of his heavy armor almost like an hammer being beaten on an anvil.
he opened fire. Literally, He started burning every single plant in his field of view.
the eldritch flames devoured the plant life at unthinkable speeds, rendering the main entrance of the camp burning piles in no time.
the wood elves that saw this horror either ran away or armed themselves. some took bows, some steel swords.
Many archers started firing Aether infused arrows at the intruder.
the arrows glowed green, blessed by the Queen of Life herself.
some other wood elves, with a deeper connection with the force of nature, summoned woodwraiths and tree-revenants, to stop this madness.
Ashalut, a skilled warrior with a three-arrow reinforced bow rolled out of his tent, and started firing packs of three arrow in a rapid fire fashion.
some of the lesser arrows broke as soon as they hit kuroto, but the infused ones, and the ones fired from Ashalut did manage to at least dent the armor, and remain stuck in place.
that was Ashalut's plan. from the arrows vines grew at record-breaking speed, trying to tie kuroto and render him immobile.
But Kuroto ripped away the vines with ease; he slid his claws in the main body of the plant, then he threw them away, almost in an disgusted manner.
He opened the two fire breathing weapon again, burning some elves that were charging him, taking advantage of his distraction.
they burned. their body turned into charred statues in a few second. that was the power of the Eldritch Flames.
The woodwraiths charged at him, with a very fast yet elegant sprint. Pinning his arms to his side, they tried to keep him busy and clog the flamethrowsers while the tree-reventant advanced at their fastest pace to maul him.

<i>you said we had a bright future togheter. you said that we could stay togheter forever. you the Priestess, I the hammer and enforcer of your edicts.
    but you lied to me. you used me for the fact that I was touched only for your benefits. You never really cared about me.</i>

Kuroto stood still as the tree-revenants approached, but then, his two forbidden firearms changed shape: the barrel retracted, the mouths closed, and some other panels of the amor slid;  suddenly his two arms were on fire, burning the two woodwraiths down to their life energy.
after the two wraiths literally disintegrated, he looked at the tree-revenants close to him.
He lifted his arms to the tree monsters, and then launched the two blue flames at them, who caught fire instantly, an in matter of second, they turned into ash.
he readjusted the weapons, to keep firing, but this time it was a more concentrated jet, a smaller but longer tongue of blue eldritch flame.
he burned the archers. He burned the archer towers, with the archer themselves inside. He burned the skilled bowsmen that tried to stop him with various earth-aether infused darts or arrows.
Ashalut prayed to the Queen of Life; he got on his knees, drew the rune of the Queen and asked her for help.
the rune glowed: his bow was wrapped in a green light, and suddenly it became bigger and stronger, it resembled a dwarf-made quad-crossbow more than a bow now, and it shot etheric darts.
Asharuth gave his oath, and then started to fire a barrage of these phatom green arrows at Kuroto.
they did some damage to his armor. small cracks sarted to appear, one even entered with the tip in a crack and then exploded, trying to chip away as much as possible at his armor.
Kuroto payed him no attention. he was more focused on nonsensical burning of everything. Tents, People, Everything in the camp site of this tribe.
"FACE ME YOU MONSTER!"
Kuroto Turned on him. even though he was faceless at the moment, Asharuth knew they were looking eachother in the eyes.
"You're the red wake."
Kuroto nodded silently.
"your tide ends here. for I, in the name of the Queen of Life, will stop you, even if it takes my life!"

<i>you betrayed my trust. you betrayed my love. you betrayed everything of me.</i>

Kuroto slid back his flamers and approached Asharuth.

<i>so let it be war.</i>

the elf drew his sword, which was glowing with power from the Queen, and charged at him.
But Kuroto caught the sword with his immense talons, broke it, then impaled Asharuth the second after.

<i>I will burn everything you hold dear. </i>

His forbidden flamethrowers came back, and he started to burn again everything in his field of view.

<i> I will destroy you little pacific empire. I helped built it. I can bring it down too. </i>

with Asharuth still impaled on his talons, he burned everything and everyone, leaving ashes and eldritch fires behind.
he was not only burning passively. he was actively pursuing the fleeing elves, to then burn them alive in those paranormally hungry flames.
charred corpses were behind him. many. many more hidden between the ashes of tents and wood structures. ash, still flaming with that strange blue flame, piles of them, everywhere. two big ones, still on fire, where the tree-revenant were.

<i>I will make you watch as the entire world around you crumble.
    let the forests burn.
    let the cities falls.
    i will tear down every single curch of the Great Winged God, with my bare hands. </i>

<!-- Kuroto sensed the Queen of Life: She was trying to take Asharuth's sould and reincarnate it as a high treespirit. but he stopped her. as the Queen plucked the soul from his body into the aether, he grasped it, with an avatar of him in the aether, and took it away from the queen's grasp. -->
Kuroto sensed the Queen of Life: She was trying to take Asharuth's soul and reincarnate him as a high treespirit.
He let her.
he saw green energy leaving from the body.
from the soil a tree started to grew at neck-breaking speed. it was 10m High in no time. it started twisting into an humanoid form, as the green energy entered his bark.
a face appeared in the bark. green eyes, an angry mouth, which spilled green fumes.
<i> I WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING, EVEN IF IT TAKES THE LAST DROP OF MY BLOOD. </i>
he launched away the elf cadaver, then raised his claws: green sparks started forming around him, and his claws turned purple. From the palm of his hand a purple jet of flame started, going right into the high tree-spirit.
this time the tree-spirit did not burn. he just started to decay, rotting. lively brown bark turning into black dust, which in turn turned into ka pool.
he felt the horror of the Queen of Life. He sensed her rush to tear away the soul of Asharuth from the material body before it's soul too was consumed.
he did not care if she managed to do it or not. the ka pool started to slowly move to his feet.
the giant tree warrior was gone. corrupted by forbidden eldritch ka.
the spirits of the elves that he burned, now turned into ka things, emerged to then dive back from the black pool.

all around him blue flames. if no one intervened, these flames will consume the entire forest.
He did not care.
This was only a show of power, and a test to see his newly regained Eldritch powers.
It was also a signal, a message.
he looked the blue flames dancing around him.
it was a challenge. Come and get me. Come and kill me. Stop me. Try it.

<i> and if that is not enough, I will kill the god you hold so dear, so close, the god you betrayed me for. </i>
<i>I will kill the Great Winged God.</i>
