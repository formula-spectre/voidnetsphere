after feeling betrayed by Rikka, high priestess of the city of Nazakul, Kuroto, or as the elves now know him, "Herutiano" (lord of artificial things) abandonded the city, in searching of something to shower his rage on. he destroyed many black and green orcs tribes. Wood elves and dark elves that he encountered were not excluded from his raging march.
the wood elves tried to fight him, but his sheer technomancy and master of machinery destroyed entire settlements; the dark elves were bested in using the Ka, since now Kuroto was not wearing the white stone  of legends anymore on his neck.
for a while he disappeared, until something, deep within the forest, and very far from any city was built; it was a 10x10x10 pure concrete room, with only a throne made of the flesh of the killed orcs inside;
there, Herutiano was sitting, in his gigantic power armor.
He felt betrayed by the Great Winged God, and most importanly, by Rikka.
So he threw away those ten years of religious purification, and fully embraced the eldritch energy that touched him so long ago; there, in his cubicle of concrete, his mastery over machinery, body and Ka grew so rapidly that he started to influence the word around him;
at first it was making the grass slowly, then rapidly wither around his settlement; then bushes shriveled up in a clumb of black leaves and branches, then trees died, falling like soldiers in a war, breaking like they once wood trunks were made of paper.
And then, after one whisper from beyond, he kidnapped a female wood elf;
He got up from his flesh and concrete throne, grabbed his sword, and went hunting.
he traveled the south forest of Boscoalto, and soon enough he found a small tribe of wood elves.
bloodshed. he killed every single one of them.
except for one woman. who he tied up, and kidnapped, bringing her to his concrete home.
Prison. grey walls, only small windows with metal bars.
She was a prisoner.
Trapped in his cubicle, the woof elf, Nashura, experienced one of his many experiments;
Herutiano soldered off some of his armor.
he took away a small piece, so small that it was barely a palm in size. but his armor grew back.
He took this eldritch living metal, and implated it in her womb.
Nashura felt pain. she cried, for she was essentialy raped by needles and machinery.
she cried and cried.
But no matter how much she desperated herself, in her, it grew. The living metal, touched by the forces beyond, grew.
it took 120 days, then Nashura gave birth; she did not birth a child, but instead, the metal, in a liquid form; it was way more than the one that Herutiano implated her.
During the pregnancy, the metal, or rather, the Forces, infected her brain.
now she wasn't desperate anymore.
Now she loved Herutiano for what he did to her.
she Worshipped Herutiano. she became his wife.
she standed naked before him. the living metal now wrapping around her, donning her in biomechanical silk robes.
this was only the beginning.
Herutiano's plan was in motion. his rage has been quenched, but it lingered, it became a subttle devilish malice. malice against the world. he was angry at Rikka, the Church of the Great Winged one, he was angry at the world.
Malice. Bitterness.
Nashura, now calling herself Vunda-i-autane, the mother of machines, disguised herself as a wood elf once again, donning her old robes, and went to another wood elf tribe.
there, she abducted more women, with her charm and charisma, and brought them right into the cubibcle, where she then revelaed her true form, and impregnated them with more of the eldritch metal.
these first 12 women will be known as the high priestess, in a mockery of the church of the great winged one.
they too, after 120 days, birthed more eldritch metal; all while Herutiano was on his throne, watching.
He got up from his throne, kidnapped some dark elves, and did horrible experiment to them; he lobotomized them, gave them extra mechanical arm, and infected their mind with the eldritch metal.
he then gathered his wife, his 12 high priestess, and the dark elves abominations he made.
he drew on their forehead a symbol; a circle, with an eye on it, and a line passing through it; similar to the greek letter phi, but with an eye inside; this was the seal of Herutiano. They were now under his control. Slaves to his will if you will.
he sent the Homonculi, that's how he called the twisted dark elves he made, to gather more elves, female or male;
and more elves were gathered; fire, wood, water, dark, every kind.
each day 6 men and 6 women were gathered.
the men were transmutated, twisted into biomechanical abominations, homunculi, while the women were brainwashed and became nuns of Herutiano, carrying in their womb the cursed metal.
his cubicle started growing into a tower. the metal itself, blended with the flesh of the orks that Herutiano gathered on his killing sprees, was the foundation, the walls, the doors, the everything of his first house, then palace, then tower.
each high priestess carried and nun carried in their womb the metal; every 120 days they would birth it in liquid form, to then get reimpregnated and make more.
the tower was growing, and so was Herutiano's knowledge and Power. with all of the elditch living metal and flesh of men he made copies of himself. 12 to be exact. he then put them in special cryo-pods.
another cycle of pregnancy.
the tower grew.
another cycle of pregnancy
the tower became taller.
another cycle of pregnancy.
more homonculi. now they were divided in classes: low ranking servitor, simply lobotomized men/elves who served the nuns, janitors, which were not lobotomized but rather brainwashed, which mantained the structures; then the hunters, twisted yet refined, who helped Herutiano in slaughtering or kidnapping.
and so the cult of the Artificial Machine grew.
the nuns and priestess were constantly pregnant with that abominable metal, to grow
Herutiano's plan was simple. challenge the Winged god, by artifically becoming one, and fight him.
destroy the church by destroying the very thing they worship.
