    <h2 id="lovecraft"> a small story about how H.P. Lovecraft's gods fit in this universe</h2>
    <pre>
        <!--
             there was once a boy named Philip H. LoveCraft; his dream was to venture beyond the known world.
             he studied hard, navigated the 16 seas of the mortal realm.
             soon enough, at the ripe age of 20, his dream was reality: he was a skilled and renowed traveler.
             one day, he asked himself what lies beyond.
             and then, he took off. he went far and wide, reaching the edge of the mortal realm.
             Going in the nine spheres, the nine realms, every realm possible. he visited them all.
             then, when everything seemed conquered, he ventured even more beyond, in the eternally still void.
             his ship was found at the shore of south Pacific-west Ugul ocean.
             there, the boy was nowhere to be found. but there was a book.
             no one has read the book beyond the first page.
             the first page reads:
             "THERE ARE GODS BEYOND OUR COMPREHENSIONS; GODS OF PURE MADNESS."
             "THEY WATCH US. THEY ARE WATCHING OUR WORLD OUR LIVES OUR EVERYTHING"
             "THERE IS SOMETHING DEEP BELOW THE WATERS"
             "YOG-SOTHOTH IS THE KEY"
             "AZATHOTH DREAMS"
             "NYARLATHOTHEP WATCHES US."
             to this day, reading the incoherent ramblings of the boy is hard, and only the most skilled priests can do that.
             something lurks. not in the shadows, but above us.
             in the deep waters.
             in the deep black sky of infinity.
             something sentient.
        -->
In the mortal realm, young Lovecraft yearned,
Philip, the seeker, wisdom he earned.
Navigating seas, sixteen to roam,
Explorer bold, forging paths far from home.

At twenty, adept, a renowned voyager,
Beyond known borders, his ventures eager.
He pondered the vastness beyond mere sight,
Set sail for realms in the boundless night.

Through spheres and realms, his ship did soar,
Exploring each domain, to know them more.
But at the edge where the void holds sway,
The boy vanished from the earthly fray.

No trace was left but a tome's first leaf,
A cryptic message, causing disbelief.
"Gods beyond, in realms unknown they roam,
Madness they hold, in realms they call home.

They watch our world, our lives, our fate,
Horrors beneath the waters wait.
Yog-Sothoth, the key, secrets to unveil,
Azathoth's dreams, in madness prevail.

Nyarlahtothep's gaze upon us falls,
In cryptic whispers, ancient lore calls.
In shadows deep or above us high,
A sentience lurks, in the infinite sky."

This tale's arcane whispers, cryptic and dread,
Unveil mysteries yet to be read.
Only the priests, skilled and wise,
Decipher the truth within dark skies.

    <h2 id="hexagram"> The hexagram of the six basic forces of magic</h2>
    <img src="hexagram.png" style="width:500px;height:500px;">
    <pre>
this is the basic hexagram of magic; the sephiroth of magic has this node as the base for all type of magic (image coming soon until I can tame gimp)
Ha: the force of life
Ka: the force of deth
Ba: the force of the body
fire: to keep us warm
lightning: to motivate and move (phisically) us
ice: to keep us togheter
Ha, Ka and Ba create one trinity; the trinity of life;
Ice, Lightning and Fire creates another trinity: the trinity of spirit;
these two trinities can work independently, but when they overlap, they make the universe spin; it's the fundamental forces of everything powered by magic; all six combined create the Aether, which is raw mana unfiltered. this "drips" down the sephiorth, and in the other nodes of magic, powering them.
(more to come, and need furter elaborating)

    <h2 id="dwarves"> random notes about dwarves and gnomes </h2>
    <pre>
dwarves are are a proud race, with a craftmanship renowed all around the world.
they're stubborn, hold grudges, like the typical dwarf archetype, but the Craftman aspect is more focused in this universe.
the dwarves are known mostly for two things, beside their craftmanship:
1) the iron dwarves
the iron dwarves are Automatas that resemble the dwarves in everything; matter of fact the dwarves see them not as a tool, but as their own kind; the artifical brain of the iron dwarves is very advanced, and while they know that they're not a real dwarf, they still rock the world, Almost like an adoptive child to his parent.
the Iron Dwarves assists the Dwarves in every tasks, that be mining or simply crafting finer tool.
(more to come)
2) gnomes; gnomes are a bio engineered race of "lesser dwarves"; they're smaller, and they were made by the dwarves to help them hunt food in the forest and go into the small tunnels underground.
after the great schism of stone, the dwarves let the gnomes be their own thing; and over time the gnomes evolved both culturarlly and phisically different from the dwarves; while they still hold a good relationship with them, now they're they have their own identity.
    </pre>

    <h2 id="halflings">halfings</h2>
<pre>
as of now halflings (hobbits, half-men), are under the umbrella of "mutant", and they're the best regarded mutant of the world.
they're very laid back, prefer to stay close together, and overall are a friendly race of farmers.
they have many talents, but the most prominent one is farming; they excel at taking care of soil and plant. that is why sometimes they get hired to look over garden or green houses.
the halflings have a deep connection with the spirit and wind of earth, that is why they mostly go around bare-footed; to feel that connection to the earth; they like to roam in large green pastures, tend animals and collect weeds that they find.
but their race is quite poor; the few halfling cities that exists are rural, with a part dedicated to the homes, which usually are dug under the ground, and most of the space dedicated to gardens.
they have a very good relationship with many wood elves tribes, since both races are connected to the earth. they're also resistant to the forces of Beyond,Ka,and the shadows, since at heart they're pure.
there is one halfling that fell to the shadow, but that is a story for another day.
more to come.

<h2 id="herutiano">Herutiano, Kuroto and how the war of the artificial gods started. </h2> <br>
spoilers for the first part of the saga
<pre>
after feeling betrayed by Rikka, high priestess of the city of Nazakul, Kuroto, or as the elves now know him, "Herutiano" (lord of artificial things) abandonded the city, in searching of something to shower his rage on. he destroyed many black and green orcs tribes. Wood elves and dark elves that he encountered were not excluded from his raging march.
the wood elves tried to fight him, but his sheer technomancy and master of machinery destroyed entire settlements; the dark elves were bested in using the Ka, since now Kuroto was not wearing the white stone  of legends anymore on his neck.
for a while he disappeared, until something, deep within the forest, and very far from any city was built; it was a 10x10x10 pure concrete room, with only a throne made of the flesh of the killed orcs inside;
there, Herutiano was sitting, in his gigantic power armor.
He felt betrayed by the Great Winged God, and most importanly, by Rikka.
So he threw away those ten years of religious purification, and fully embraced the eldritch energy that touched him so long ago; there, in his cubicle of concrete, his mastery over machinery, body and Ka grew so rapidly that he started to influence the word around him;
at first it was making the grass slowly, then rapidly wither around his settlement; then bushes shriveled up in a clumb of black leaves and branches, then trees died, falling like soldiers in a war, breaking like they once wood trunks were made of paper.
And then, after one whisper from beyond, he kidnapped a female wood elf;
He got up from his flesh and concrete throne, grabbed his sword, and went hunting.
he traveled the south forest of Boscoalto, and soon enough he found a small tribe of wood elves.
bloodshed. he killed every single one of them.
except for one woman. who he tied up, and kidnapped, bringing her to his concrete home.
Prison. grey walls, only small windows with metal bars.
She was a prisoner.
Trapped in his cubicle, the woof elf, Nashura, experienced one of his many experiments;
Herutiano soldered off some of his armor.
he took away a small piece, so small that it was barely a palm in size. but his armor grew back.
He took this eldritch living metal, and implated it in her womb.
Nashura felt pain. she cried, for she was essentialy raped by needles and machinery.
she cried and cried.
But no matter how much she desperated herself, in her, it grew. The living metal, touched by the forces beyond, grew.
it took 120 days, then Nashura gave birth; she did not birth a child, but instead, the metal, in a liquid form; it was way more than the one that Herutiano implated her.
During the pregnancy, the metal, or rather, the Forces, infected her brain.
now she wasn't desperate anymore.
Now she loved Herutiano for what he did to her.
she Worshipped Herutiano. she became his wife.
she standed naked before him. the living metal now wrapping around her, donning her in biomechanical silk robes.
this was only the beginning.
Herutiano's plan was in motion. his rage has been quenched, but it lingered, it became a subttle devilish malice. malice against the world. he was angry at Rikka, the Church of the Great Winged one, he was angry at the world.
Malice. Bitterness.
Nashura, now calling herself Vunda-i-autane, the mother of machines, disguised herself as a wood elf once again, donning her old robes, and went to another wood elf tribe.
there, she abducted more women, with her charm and charisma, and brought them right into the cubibcle, where she then revelaed her true form, and impregnated them with more of the eldritch metal.
these first 12 women will be known as the high priestess, in a mockery of the church of the great winged one.
they too, after 120 days, birthed more eldritch metal; all while Herutiano was on his throne, watching.
He got up from his throne, kidnapped some dark elves, and did horrible experiment to them; he lobotomized them, gave them extra mechanical arm, and infected their mind with the eldritch metal.
he then gathered his wife, his 12 high priestess, and the dark elves abominations he made.
he drew on their forehead a symbol; a circle, with an eye on it, and a line passing through it; similar to the greek letter phi, but with an eye inside; this was the seal of Herutiano. They were now under his control. Slaves to his will if you will.
he sent the Homonculi, that's how he called the twisted dark elves he made, to gather more elves, female or male;
and more elves were gathered; fire, wood, water, dark, every kind.
each day 6 men and 6 women were gathered.
the men were transmutated, twisted into biomechanical abominations, homunculi, while the women were brainwashed and became nuns of Herutiano, carrying in their womb the cursed metal.
his cubicle started growing into a tower. the metal itself, blended with the flesh of the orks that Herutiano gathered on his killing sprees, was the foundation, the walls, the doors, the everything of his first house, then palace, then tower.
each high priestess carried and nun carried in their womb the metal; every 120 days they would birth it in liquid form, to then get reimpregnated and make more.
the tower was growing, and so was Herutiano's knowledge and Power. with all of the elditch living metal and flesh of men he made copies of himself. 12 to be exact. he then put them in special cryo-pods.
another cycle of pregnancy.
the tower grew.
another cycle of pregnancy
the tower became taller.
another cycle of pregnancy.
more homonculi. now they were divided in classes: low ranking servitor, simply lobotomized men/elves who served the nuns, janitors, which were not lobotomized but rather brainwashed, which mantained the structures; then the hunters, twisted yet refined, who helped Herutiano in slaughtering or kidnapping.
and so the cult of the Artificial Machine grew.
the nuns and priestess were constantly pregnant with that abominable metal, to grow
Herutiano's plan was simple. challenge the Winged god, by artifically becoming one, and fight him.
destroy the church by destroying the very thing they worship.
he shall become a god, by any mean necessary.
an artificial one. like the things he made.
the artifical god of artificial life.

<h2 id="Kuroto">Some Snippets of Kuroto before he came Herutiano</h2>
treat these as demos; there are random snippets that I write down from time to time (read: when my adhd feels nice), that will eventually be included in the second war of the gods arc.
<hr>
<pre>
kuroto and Daniel were circling against eachother.
the crowd that formed around them made an almost perfect circle, creating an arena of some sort.
"It's payback time computer guy" Daniel said, with a grin on it's face
"We're out of school, this means that both of us can harm the other one without consequences. You know that right?"
"Of course I do. when I heard that you would've come here I did not hesitate. This is payback for last time"
"Last time?"
"yes, when you defended that moth abomination."
"oh, Helen. You had no right to pick on her, expecially since you too are a freak".
Daniel was brandishing a spiked club, while Kuroto had no apparent weapon.
But inside him, electricity was building, along with rage.
it was not rage against Daniel, just an emotion caused by the feeling of doign harm: it was just a byproduct of harming Daniel and letting out some steam.
but outside kuroto did not show any of that. his face was the always calm, almost annoyed or tired one.
"This is not going to end well for you." Daniel said, leveling his club to Kuroto.
Kuroto did not react to the insult, He just stopped walking in the circle. Ready to fight.
Daniel sprung forward, already tasting and seeing the face of Kuroto broken and mangled by his club.
Kuroto was swift. He ducked, lunched himself forward, into the foe; He parried the club with his left bare hand, twisted it, then used his right hand to punch the wrist of Daniel; these two actions, done at the exact same time, with almost chiurgical precision, made sure that the grip on the wepon loosen, and that was all Kuroto needed.
He grabbed the wrist, and jerked down his entire arm with enough force to make the club slip from the hand of the owner. he kicked it away, and with the wrist still held tight, he pulled the foe to himself;
he jerked his arm up, and then back down, making the elbow joint ecounter his thrusting upward knee. the arm bended, but wrongly, on the other side.
the elbow joint broke.
Kuroto did not miss a beat; he jumped, describing an arc, landing on the other side of Daniel, twisting his wrist in the process.
he bended his arm on the wrong side, pulling it on Daniel's back.
finally, he let go of the wrist, backing away.
Daniel screamed in pain, as his fractured elbow was udner stress due the final position his arm was in.
with his trembling good arm he tried to undo the positino and get the arm in a neutral position. the fractured joint still hurt, but this mitigated the pain some.
Kuroto watched him, without flinching. he did not say anything, nor looked up to watch the crowd.
more violence was building in him, but with an exhale, he let it go.
"YOU BASTARD" Daniel composed himself and tried to punch kuroto straight into the jaw, like he did at school.
in a flash, the violence in Kuroto surged again: He had a brief vision, that lasted not even a second, of that black monolith; He blocked the fist, then with a swift motion he jerked away Danie's arm, to then sprin around on his heel; using his bioelectricity he gained strenght, so much as to lift kuroto, as a child would lift a doll, to then topple him on the ground with violence, probably fracturing his backspine.
for good measure, he twisted the wrist and broke it.
"had enough? I have places to be." said Kuroto finally.
"You... bastard" Daniel was squirming in pain. his elbow, his wrists, his back, everything hurts.
"You're lucky that we didn't drew blood. it would've gotten messy fast."
"You.. you are.. dead" kuroto spat some blood and saliva. he was foaming, but the sheer pain of his broken joints paralized him.
"maybe." said kuroto, slowly walking away.
"but if I die i will take you with me."
the crowd who was shouting when Daniel first charged Kuroto, now was silent at the turn of events.
Kuroto did not even use his electricity to inflict more pain to Daniel.
He made a mental note of that.
next time he would use double.
"as a pay back" he tought, as he returned to where he was sitting.
"What the hell happened here?" the orator master came to the scene.
"What did you two do!?" was his exclamation when he saw Daniel getting helped on his feet.
"he attacked me. I defended myself." was the only thing Kuroto said.
"you broke his elbow!" roared the master
"and his wrists."
"do you!.. do you even have an idea.." the orator master was so furious that he could not find the proper words.
Kuroto did not answer. Matter of fact he didn't even looked at him. he was focusing on the green landscape of the playing field, waiting for the hour to pass so he could go home.
"you, come with me!" The master orator grabbed kuroto's hand.
"where?"
"we will have a long talk about what happened." said the man, composing himself.
"i'm not in the mood to talk."
"I don't care, you're in big trouble. The custodians will teach you a lesson."
"custodians? does this mean that the High Priestess will be there?"
"psh, of course!.. if she's not busy. she will suringly punish your bad behaviour!"
Kuroto Jerked away the grip of the man, but still followed him.

"Look, I know that you did that in self-defense."
the master orator and Kuroto where sitting in a small grey room, with a window over the playfield. he was way calmer than before, almost as if the anger he showed in public was just for show.
"do you know daniel?"
"you said the High Priestess would meet me."
"..."
silence fell.
"Do you know Daniel?"
Kuroto did not answer, but instead, looked at the orator straight into his eyes
"..I see now. you followed me just because you wanted to meet the High Priestess.."
Kuroto's expression did not change.
"I'll bring you to her, but first, answer my question."
"I know who daniel is. he is friend with Konah, which is the son of the head of the organized crime in this city. he will surely tell him of today, and Konah will mark me as an enemy, and he will use his father's lackeys to do me harm."
The orator was robbed of his thoughts.
"He already tried to do that to my mother. I sent him a message."
the man was now puzzled.
"they came asking my mother for the "protection" fee."
he was beginning to connect the pieces.
"dear winged one.. so you were behind that.."
"yes. I told them, to tell him, that he can target me all he wants, but he even dares to touch my mother or her activity.. well.."
he trailed off, letting the implication sink in the man's mind.
"you're putting yourself in great risks young man.." he finally said.
"I don't particulary care to be honest."
silence fell again, this time it felt heavy for the orator.
he heard that Kuroto was pretty weird, but this?
"now." started Kuroto, breaking his train of thoughts.
"yes, you want to see the High Priestess.. I don't actually-"
"and you will see me." a voice surpised both.
Rikka, the High Priestess, was standing on the entrance of the room.
"High Priestess! it's-" the man rose up like a spring, but was interrupted.
"no need Calan, sit down."
Kuroto was staring at her.
"So, Kuroto, why did you want to see me?"
"..." Kuroto did not say anything.
for the first time, the orator saw kuroto's expression change: it was almost imperceptible, but some mixture of happyness and fluster blinked on his face, for not even a fraction for a second.
did he imagined that? Kuroto was well known for having one expression: a tired one, the face of a sleepless man. it was not an evil expression, neither sad or angry, it was just.. his expression.
"High Priestess.." Kuroto said after some silence, in a low tone, bordering to a whisper.
"Yes?"
He stood up, and slowly walked to the woman.
they looked at eachother in the eye for what seemed like an eternity, then kuroto looked down.
"I think this belongs to you."
He held a silver ring, with a blue stone in it.
the High Priestess looked at it, her expression was surpised. she gently took it from Kuroto's palm.
"why thank you! this ring is very important to me!"
"I figured, the gem is pure zapphire cut by the master dwarf Unglin.."
"My most sincere gratitudes Kuroto!" she smiled. her smile, so warm and gentle, almost like a caring mother's.
"Where and how did you find it?"
"I found it on the ground near the entrace to the church.. I think it might have slippen off your finger when the cerimony of Blessing was over.."
"I'm quite sure that is when it happened. I should ask master Unglin to tighten it a bit.. my most sencere gratitude Kuroto, i would've been very sad if I lost this ring."
Kuroto was silent, his pallid cheek with a hind of flustering, looking at his side.
The High Priestess lifted her hand, and rested it over Kuroto's hair. She gently caressed his brown hairs.
"Good boy" she said, with the same warm smile.
Kuroto this time did flinch. Almost like he was caught off guard by that act.
He stepped back.
The woman was surprised at his reaction, but at the same time, she somewhat expected it.
Kuroto stood immobile for a few seconds, before making for the exit of the room.
"Kuroto.." The High Priestess tried to stop him with words.
He indeed stopped, but did not turn around.
"Next time.. can you please not do that? it was very hard to heal those two men.. and now they're blinded for life since your electricity melted their eyes.."
"...It was a message."
"and the message was?"
"stay away from my mother."
"that's noble of you, but.. don't you think it was a bit too extreme? playing with someone else's life?"
the tone of the High Priestess was not accusatory, nor angry or disappointed, her was the tone of a mother who tried to understand his son.
"for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction." he said coldly.
the high orator felt like a freezing cold blade go through his heart.
"I..see.." said the High Priestess.
She tried to once again cares Kuroto's Head, but as she stepped forward, so did he.
"..next time, try to not gain the attention of the Custodians, okay?"
"..." Kuroto left the room.
"..so you know it was him?" said the orator to the woman, who was putting back the ring on her finger.
"yes. inside his eyes I saw violence and anger. the sheer brutality that afflicted those men and the fact that they had burn marks all over them, and their eyes literally exploded, made me think that Kuroto was the one behind their sorry state."
"He knows that he's basically putting himself against the entire mafia of Katmin, but-"
"he'd rather paint the target on his back than let his mother succumb to them."
"..exactly. And while that's noble, I am worried for him."
"so am I. but he's a fighter. if the Divinatorium Sphere is correct, and after today, I am sure it is, he can bring go toe-to-toe against the army of Katmin, and even Katmin himself, and still rise on the top. yet.."
"yet?"
"...with great power cometh great responsabilities.."
"what are you implying my lady?"
"..."
She paused for a second, trying to put togheter a sentence that described one of the visions of the Divinatorium chamber.
"...Nothing." she gave up. What she saw.. no. it was not a future that will not manifest. not under her watch, so she didn't even try to empower that future by explaining what she saw.
She exited the room, with her usual grace, and two Custodiands excorted her to her room.
