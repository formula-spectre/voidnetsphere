<pre>
it was noon.
a deer was eating grass peacefully.
a red marker appeared on it's brown fur.
Ten meters away there was someone. he was under a camo sheet. He had a gun with a silencer.
his face was covered by a gas mask, with four tubes and blacked out glass for the eyes.
he moved the gun, and now the red dot was on the deer&rsquo;s neck. then down. The person was aiming at the heart.
One shot. that is what it took to end that deer&rsquo;s life. the projectile pierced the deer whole, and it's heart.
the deer fell on the ground.
the Man got up, took off the camo sheet, folded it and put it on his back. He approached the dead body of the deer. with a black wire he tied up all four legs.
"HEY YOU!"
the man got up quickly, allarmed.
"hunting is ille-"
he could not finish the sentence; the ranger's heart stopped. Another projectile through the heart with surgical accuracy.
the killer dragged the man's body near the deer's.
he took the ranger's badge, and gently put it on the ground. after tying him up, the mysterious figure carried the two corpses away.

<h3>this tale is a a way for me to vent; I am aware that it's not gonna be that good, that the mc is an everyman and a mary sue, and it's overly edgy, but please, understand the purpose, and also, criticize this! so I can use piecies of this tale to write better ones </h3>

the killer had three deer bodies before him.
he took some tubes, and put one end of the jugulars of the dead animals. with a pump, he started draining all the blood, storing it in a glass tank.
he put two more tubes on each deer, so to pump out the blood faster.
he looked at his left. the ranger&rsquo;s body was already drained of his blood.
the pale flesh had needle everywhere.
he took a knife; the blade started glowing red, and slowly,  he started cutting the flesh of the deer before him.
an hissing sound, and some smoke; a leg was now detached from the main body.
slowly he teared off the skin, and the the flesh.
There was no blood leakage; the knife almost insulated the flesh's blood vessels.
but then he sticked needles in the various cuts of flesh, to drain blood; it went in a different container.
