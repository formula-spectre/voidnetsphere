Interdimensional Heavy Industries - Bio Weapon Division <br>

Item number: #3294, BWD-#3294-fb338-PN <br>

Item name: "Gauna" Project <br>

Item class: Bio-Organic Weapon <br>


 Description: <br>
 <br>
the "Gauna" (Quintaxjan for "Strangely created Creature - Ga-au-Nahji") Project Consist in a Main alive component, Called Gauna-0, and Sub-species created by it. <br>
 <br>
Gauna-0 is a creature, Bio-mechanical-type [1], Composed principally by one head, four arms, a tail, and tentacles. due to the unstable DNA, Gauna-0 must be contained in a level 5 cryogenic pod, with restriction of two atheros-6 chain per limb. the Tentacles, if not too big, can be restricted with a atheros-2 chain per extension. <br>
This report is gonna focus mainly on Gauna-0, to see the derivations, consult the adjacent database. <br>
 <br>
 Physical Description <br>
 <br>
Gauna-0's Head does not feature any visible visual organ. the upper part of the head is enclosed in a translucent dome, with approximately 2 organs. one of which is a giant compounded structure, that reflects photons, infra-red rays and UV rays. So to speak it can be considered a giant eye of class 4. the second organ is another compounded one, this time two cavities folded on themselves multiple times, with pheromone receptors inside. <br>
The only visible feature on Gauna-0's head is the mouth, with approximately 40 teeth, 20 upper and 20 lower. These teeth seem to be divided in various categories, to facilitate the breaking and chewing of virtually every material, including, but not restricted to: <br>
- Plant-based material <br>
- Flesh-based material <br>
- alkaline/ferrous material <br>
- bio-mechanical material <br>
 <br>
A tongue is also present, but the main scope is to stab enemies and inject a dose of a poisonous liquid, stored in two glands inside the lower part of the jaw. <br>
the head of Gauna-0 is fused to the neck, yet it is able tilt the head around, with around a 280 degree angle. <br>
Gauna-0's Arms are different from each other, due to the unstable nature of the project [2], but after observation a pattern emerged: <br>
 <br>
1. A more developed one, complete with muscles, claws, and metal-plating; this one has the bicep an triceps muscle exposed, to give more expansion room while flexing, although it seems that most of the time they're covered with a thick membrane made of collagen and wires. <br>
The entirety of this arm is bio-mechanical. each muscles has a spine running down it, this is partially why the bicep and triceps are semi-exposed. observation has noted that these two muscles' spines tend to expand more, especially during running or lifting. <br>
the skin is a thick and flexible material. upon analysis it seems to be small overlaid tungsten plating suspended in a type #5000 skin. more observation needs to be taken, since this tungsten skin was an irregular trait that now seems to have become regular occurrence in Gauna-0's mutation. <br>
the claws and bone plating are different than the plating on the skin, since they're made of the previous non tungsten bone. these are fully organic material. the claws seems to be biomechanoid mass folded on itself various times, with many breaking point so to quickly lose a dull claw and replace it by pushing a new one out. <br>
more observation is needed. <br>
 <br>
2. a less developed one, with a five-digit hand, complete with nails. the Bicep and Triceps are biomechanoid, with similar traits to the Hujitas (see: Project #6584653429 - *Quintaxja* ). these muscles are powerful, but they do not have protection. This arm is covered in a thick skin, which does not cover the two previously mentioned muscles. to be noted is that the nails seem to have grown from inside the skin, tearing it when developed. <br>
The skin and other muscles seems not to be bio-mechanical, unlike the aforementioned triceps and bicep. While this might lead to believe to an imbalance, the organic muscle are able to develop an extraordinary amount of force, due the density of muscle fiber. <br>
OBSERVATION 2022: recently Gauna-0's organic muscle fiber has been replaced with folded biomass fibers. more observation is needed. <br>
 <br>
3. a very muscular one, with no skin, but a giant clawed hand, with each claw being approximately 30 cm. this one has the most developed deltoid of the four, and it's the most inconsistent one: The upper arm seems to be bio-mechanical, while the lower arm seems to be folded biomass, but fibers of both kind keep shifting around the whole arm, mixing the type of muscle and creating an inconsistent muscle structure. Another bizarre trait is the presence of bone spikes, but these are believed to be a result of the muscle fiber snapping the structural bones, and them growing out due misalignment. <br>
 <br>
4. The fourth arm is the most consistent biologically, but inconsistent in appearance: it mostly appears as the thin and wide, covered in translucent skin, with a single hand whose digit range from 5 to 10. it seem that this arm can stretch to an extend, and it's composed by folded bio-mechanical fibers interlaced with both collagen and normal biological muscle fibers. <br>
SPECIAL PROCEDURE: If more than 10 digits grow onto the hand structure, the extra digit shall be removed. the excess biomass can either be fed back to Gauna-0, or taken into the laboratory to further analyze it. <br>
 <br>
Gauna-0's Legs are mostly defined by the large biomechanoid triceps and a platigrade structure. It has been observed that the skin on the legs is very fragile in some areas; if Gauna-0 is subjected to running at a speed that is superior to 50 Km/h, the skin covering the quadriceps will rip, exposing the muscle and the spine; this is due the spine of the muscle expanding to accommodate the stress put on the muscle. <br>
to be noted: most of the times the legs sports a metal-like plating protection, but it's unknown why this trait is inconsistent. A possible theory is that this type of protection is too heavy on the legs, but why a metal-like material instead of bones in unknown. further investigation and observation needed <br>
 <br>
Gauna-0's torso spots many ribs, conjoined to a sternum. the number of the ribs is inconsistent, but the sternum can be either one or two. The lower part of Gauna-0 is mostly uncovered, exposing two large bio-mechanical muscles overlapped; each starts from one leg and ends on the opposite side of the rib cage. these two muscles have been observed in the past to have a bone plating, then a gel like covering. As of the writing of this document, these two muscles are a new kind of bio-mechanical muscle: They fuse the accordion-like structure and spine-based structure of type #0010 and #0001 bio-mechanical muscle. <br>
this new type of muscle, labeled type #0120, when injured regrows at an almost cancerous rate, doubling the size of the entire muscle. <br>
*further information can be found on BMS-#0120* <br>
 <br>
Gauna-0 cryo-pod is the number 000000122. it must be kept at a sub zero temperature, with range varying to -20 under zero and -10. failure to contain the entity this way might result in neural activity and reaction to external stimuli, which can lead to contamination if a breach happens. if such thing happens, use cryogenic equipment, with the objective to freeze the entity at a temperature somewhere between -272 and -500. Gauna-0 will then be thaw in cryo-pod no. 000000122, not before securing him in place with atheros-10 Chain per limb. after the neural activity has been restored to usual containment values, the atheros chain described in this document shall be used. <br>
