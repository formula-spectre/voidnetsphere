<h1> preamble </h1>
<pre>
I am Aegis. I was human.
I am here to record everything that has happened in the reality that we live in.
you might recognize me as Military League's top dog, or as the Vision Runner.
I am long gone from the mortal realm, even the immortal realm, and I have transcended space and time, just like "Them", and now I exist everywhere and nowhere all at once.
the Heavy Industries use a shard of me inside a Winternet robot, but I still exist outside of that shell.
let me guide you through the myths and the legends on how reality itself was born, and what is the true meaning of "life"

    <h1> Preamble</h1>
before time began, there was The One.
The One goes beyond what we define as a god or deity.
there was only The One at the beginning.
The One was a calculating machine, so it created a plane of reality for it and other beings to inhabit, which we are gonna call "The Great Beyond".
The Great Beyond is just the concept of reality existing, a flat plane of nothingness. a nothingness that is even more empty of what we can describe or think of. no vacuum of space, no virtual particles, just a flat plane of reality.
and so, reality itself was created.
then, The One split into two, and now there were two new beings in this reality.
at first, these two beings marveled at what The One created, thinking that it was perfectly clear of anything, but sooner than later these two beings knew why The One split, and what they inherited from it: a technology called life.
They were living, they were using that same technology that the one enstrusted to them.
they felt pleased with this new revelation, so they decided that they had an almost divine right to spread this technology, and experiment with it, as to honor The One.
so, those two beings split themselves again, and now there were four beings.
these four godly beings were four aspect of The One, mixed with new aspects of their own. in a sense, they were The One, but also, they were their own thing. like a child is half its mother and father, and half its own thing.
these beings wandered through the Great Beyond, experimenting with life as a technology and various other technologies.
each one went into a corner of the Great Beyond, experimenting with this new technology called life.
after wandering through the Great Beyond, marvelling at the sheer perfection of the nothingness, they felt that all this space could be used for life.
After all, The One made reality and life, so the next logical step would be to link them.
these four beings split themselves again, and now there were eight beings.
these eight beings started building a new race, in their own image.
this new race inherited the technology and gift of life.
