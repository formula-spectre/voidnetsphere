World War 102, or originally known as World War Armageddon, was (is? idk) a setting that I made up to play with some friends.
it started out as a way to have an excuse to have WW2 minis and warhammer 40k/AoS minis battling each other, then it devolved into a satirical parody of 40k 9Th edition, and then it slowly mutated in an homebrew rule system based on warhammer 7Th edition, konflikt '47, OPR and homebrew rules. The setting mutated with the game, at first it was the bare minimum to justify, then I added some more lore until it became what is it now.
we originally called it Word War Armageddon of super death because it was meant as a dumb brain-emptying game, but slowly we started to shorten it in World War Armageddon.
due the nature of the "birth" of the game the setting is satirical (and grimdank too), and has many quirks.

      <Summary> about the setting </summary>
      <p>
        the last known date is 1938; The Germans Army just enacted the Operation Valkyrie.
        they tried to carpet bomb the location where Hitler was,  but something went wrong; he was badly injured, but not dead; yet this bombing started a domino effect.
        no one knows exactly what lead to what, but something, deep beneath the oceans, fractured opened.
        every single clock stopped. something was corrupting the very tissue of reality;
        suddenly, ghosts from the past appeared; world war 1 trenches, fighting Austrian soldiers;
        the first world war overlapped on the second, while it was still going.
        no one understood at first what was going on, just that they had to shoot the enemy.
        reality distorted; the USA and USSR were now fake allies; each one had a railgun loaded with 50 nuclear heads pointed to each other, locked in a stalemate. the cold war was overlapping too with the two world wars.
        something hit the twin towers in the USA. something, someone, no one knows, yet on the 11Th of September of 1940.
        the entire world was shattered.
        the entire world was at war with each other.
        every single nation became paranoid and schizophrenic. alliances were broken as soon as they were made.
        and this was only the prelude for what was to come.
      </p>

      <p>
        Russia was the first to develop Walkers. They were slower than regular tanks, but carried more firepower and was capable to travel through every type of terrain.
        South America was the first to discover what they call The Holy Power of God; tanks animated by the Holy Spirit of God himself and used tears. tears coming from statue and painting of Mary, mother of Jesus.
        Germany dwelled into the occult, discovering the Elder things and things beyond our mind.
        England developed paranormal engines, which powered they Tesla Technologies; horrific electric energies that fried people alive.
        in time, all factions managed to reverse-engineer each other tech, leading to a gestalt of technology that bordered on the Esoteric more than science.
        the age of Diesel, gunpowder and Electricity began all at the same time.
        a new dawn. but it was not a shiny sun. it was a bleak grayish star.
      </p>

      <p>
        they say that war never changes.
        but it was changing.
        it was shifting into a new kind of war.
        a war which would lead only to one mathematical conclusion:
        complete self annihilation.f
      </p>
      this is a broad overview of the setting. it's intended to be a satirical grimdank setting. it spawned as laughing stock, but slowly i morphed it in a more grim setting because it was more fun to write in that style. <br>
      <ul> some additional notes: <br>
        <li> no one knows the year anymore. some still cling to 1940 and move forward, while some formed a new Calendar, which marks the opening of the rift as year 0, this is the AR calendar (After Rift). <br> </li>
        <li> The South of the US shattered like fine china due Christianity; it splitted into many rival, and most dangerously, zealous factions, locked in endless slaughter to defend their core belief. some sold their sold to demons or  Satan, some went mad and worshiped the Old ones. Religion plays a role, but it's not a key role, it's more of a background stuff to have Mechs powered by the Holy spirits and 30m tall walkers powered by Cthulhu <br> </li>
        <li> armies usually have some sort of power Armour or augmentation, if not, they're just sent out as cannon fodder. <i> sounds familiar? </i> </li>
      </ul>

          Britain got cursed.  Ghosts started to appear. death was feared. death became an irrational fear of everyone. except soldier of course, since their ghost would haunt the fields, but in the cities everything was done so wraiths could not disturb. <br>
          one crazy scientist found out that the ectoplasm that these ghost have can be converted into raw electricity. "Thinking, after all, is just electricity in our brain, so must be the soul!" he said. the under Winston Churchill's approval, a secret team was divided to capture all kind of ghosts and try to get their soul converted into electricity. so much was generated that it motivated the research for more complex storage systems and, most importantly, new weapons to leverage this newfound electric power. so the tesla category type of weapon was born. shooting not conventional bullets, but arcs of live lightning. <br>
          the British wage war with heavy rubber boots, heavy rifles with coils, and frying every single opponent that stands in their way. but this is only the propaganda from the outside, for the cities are rotting.

after coming in contact with their new god, they abandoned Islam, and started to worship a newfound god.
or rather, goddess.
Shub-Niggurath started to corrupt the religion at first, twisting it, to then influence the ruler of the empire, and distorting him, making him what could be best described as "a turk got Croenenberg'd".
this plague started to spread through the Ottoman empire, and now they are a race of mutants; the common infantry border on nightmarish abominations, while the "nobles" and the politicians are less mutated. the concept is imagine the average Death Guard Chaos Marine, but apply it turkish theming.

      <details id="basicrules"><summary>the rules</summary>
      <p>
basically the rules are a mutation of various ruleset that already exists, just mix n mashed togheter and later refined to suit out concept of fun. some are very straight forward, just to get the skirmish done, some are ridicously complex to have a laugh.
      </p>
      <h3>Basic rules</h3>
      the basic rules are the following: <br>
      <h2>the very first rule is: Have fun! bend the rules, or make some on the spot to spice up the game! after all, you're playing with plastic toy men, have a good time!</h2>
      
      <details id="composition"> <summary>Composition:</summary>
      there are units, then squads so this game blends wargames and skirmish games;<br>
      an unit is a singular model, while a squad is one or more model that have grouped togheter. some units do get bonunes while grouped and some don't. it's up to you to decide to have a lone operative join a squad of soldiers to give them a boost, or "pile in" as many soldiers as possible to siege a point. <br>
      every unit has a moving stat; if you formed a squad, you can decide to move every unit independently, as long as they stay somewhat close, or move them togheter as a single piece.
      </details>

      <details id="movement"> <summary>Movement:</summary>
      every unit has a movement value. actually four since we experimented with variuos systems; inces, cm, squares and even hexagons. an unit can move that much space in any direction, provided of course there is no obstacle.
      </details>

      <details id="shooting"> <summary>Shooting/melee</summary>
      shooting is simple: declare what unit, or squad, wants to fire at; then for each unit roll one d6. <br>
      every unit has a Ranged skill; if the result of the d6 is higher than it, it can shoot. <br>
      if an unit has more than one weapon of course you need to declare which one you're using, since weapons too have a range. <br>
      Melee is somewhat similar: if two units are (an arbitraty mount to be honest) close, it can declare a melee attack; roll off a d6, and then attack. <br> <br>
      armor absorbs damage; for example, if an unit has an amor value of 2, and it get hit by 4 hit points, two of them get absorbed by the armor. some kind of armor have a "max amount" of damage that it can take, in that case it's specified.
        </details>

      <details id="turnstructure"> <summary>structure of a game</summary>
          the players roll off a d6 or flip a coin to decide who goes first; <br>
          the game function on alternate activation; you pick one unit, do how many actions it can do, if your opponen can responds, then it's their turn to do the same. <br>
          a basic "turn" is structured like this:
          <ul>
            <li>Oversee: assest your units' locations, their damage and what they could do. some vehicles do have some abilites that activate in the oversee phase, so if you want/it's obligatory, declare it and apply them.</li>
            <li>Standby: if any of your action has a special rule can be activated whenever, do it now </li>
            <li>fight: pick an unit and use it's actions </li>
            <li>endphase: if there are any keywords/weapons that activate during the endphase, declare them and apply them. </li>
          </ul>
        </details>
      <details> <summary>Appendix: keywords</summary></details>

        <hr>
      <details id="units"><summary>then there are rules about the unit themselves:</summary>
      <details id="infantry"> <summary>Infantry</summary>
      the infantry has the following stats: <br>
      <ul>
          <li> <em>Health</em>: how many hit points before it dies</li>
          <li> <em>Armor</em>: a protection that gives maluses when attacked</li>
          <li> <em>Ranged Weapon Skill</em>: how good that unit is at using shooty shooty</li>
          <li> <em>Meelee Weapon Skill</em>: How good that unit is in cqc</li>
          <li> <em>Leadership</em>: this number determines how hard is to shock/scare/fatigue the unit</li>
          <li> <em>Movement</em>: how many cm/inches/squares/whatever it can move </li>
          <li> <em>Actions</em>: How many actions that unit can do in one turn</li>
      </ul>
      some units have other stats, but it usually depends from unit to unit. <br>

as you can see it's quite basic; you have your unit, and you have a weapon.
to shoot with the rifle you roll off a d6 for Ranged Skill; if you score more than the number, you can shoot with a weapon.
