<h1> World war 102: Entire Worlds at War </h1>
<i>the war has been going for almost a century! untold billions died! Help! I cannot wake up from this nightmare! I cannot wake up!</i>

<i>Do you think Satan or God is afraid of the Old Ones?</i> <br>

World War 102, or originally known as World War Armageddon, was (is? idk) a setting that I made up to play with some friends.
it started out as a way to have an excuse to have WW2 minis and warhammer 40k/AoS minis battling each other, then it devolved into a satirical parody of 40k 9Th edition, and then it slowly mutated in an homebrew rule system based on warhammer 7Th edition, konflikt '47, OPR and homebrew rules. The setting mutated with the game, at first it was the bare minimum to justify, then I added some more lore until it became what is it now.
we originally called it Word War Armageddon of super death because it was meant as a dumb brain-emptying game, but slowly we started to shorten it in World War Armageddon.
due the nature of the "birth" of the game the setting is satirical (and grimdank too), and has many quirks.
</pre>
<h2> about the setting </h2>
<pre>
the last known date is 1938; The Germans Army just enacted the Operation Valkyrie.
they tried to carpet bomb the location where Hitler was,  but something went wrong; he was badly injured, but not dead; yet this bombing started a domino effect.
no one knows exactly what lead to what, but something, deep beneath the oceans, fractured opened.
every single clock stopped. something was corrupting the very tissue of reality;
suddenly, ghosts from the past appeared; world war 1 trenches, fighting Austrian soldiers;
the first world war overlapped on the second, while it was still going.
no one understood at first what was going on, just that they had to shoot the enemy.
reality distorted; the USA and USSR were now fake allies; each one had a railgun loaded with 50 nuclear heads pointed to each other, locked in a stalemate. the cold war was overlapping too with the two world wars.
something hit the twin towers in the USA. something, someone, no one knows, yet on the 11Th of September of 1940.
the entire world was shattered.
the entire world was at war with each other.
every single nation became paranoid and schizophrenic. alliances were broken as soon as they were made.
and this was only the prelude for what was to come.



Russia was the first to develop Walkers. They were slower than regular tanks, but carried more firepower and was capable to travel through every type of terrain.
South America was the first to discover what they call The Holy Power of God; tanks animated by the Holy Spirit of God himself and used tears. tears coming from statue and painting of Mary, mother of Jesus.
Germany dwelled into the occult, discovering the Elder things and things beyond our mind.
England developed paranormal engines, which powered they Tesla Technologies; horrific electric energies that fried people alive.
in time, all factions managed to reverse-engineer each other tech, leading to a gestalt of technology that bordered on the Esoteric more than science.
the age of Diesel, gunpowder and Electricity began all at the same time.
a new dawn. but it was not a shiny sun. it was a bleak grayish star.


they say that war never changes.
but it was changing.
it was shifting into a new kind of war.
a war which would lead only to one mathematical conclusion:
complete self annihilation.f
</pre>
this is a broad overview of the setting. it's intended to be a satirical grimdank setting. it spawned as laughing stock, but slowly i morphed it in a more grim setting because it was more fun to write in that style. <br>
<ul> some additional notes: <br>
<li> no one knows the year anymore. some still cling to 1940 and move forward, while some formed a new Calendar, which marks the opening of the rift as year 0, this is the AR calendar (After Rift). <br> </li>
<li> South America shattered like fine china due Christianity; it splitted into many rival, and most dangerously, zealous factions, locked in endless slaughter to defend their core belief. some sold their sold to demons or  Satan, some went mad and worshiped the Old ones. Religion plays a role, but it's not a key role, it's more of a background stuff to have Mechs powered by the Holy spirits and 30m tall walkers powered by Cthulhu <br> </li>
<li> armies usually have some sort of power Armour or augmentation, if not, they're just sent out as cannon fodder. <i> sounds familiar? </i> </li>
    </ul>

<h2>the rules</h2>
  <pre>
basically the rules are a mutation of various ruleset that already exists, just mix n mashed togheter and later refined to suit out concept of fun. some are very straight forward, just to get the skirmish done, some are ridicously complex to have a laugh.
  </pre>
  <h3>Basic rules</h3>
  <p>Infantry</p>
  the infantry has the following stats: <br>
  <ul>
      <li> Health: how many hit points before it dies</li>
      <li> Armor: a protection that gives maluses when attacked</li>
      <li> Ranged Weapon Skill: how good that unit is at using shooty shooty</li>
      <li> Meelee Weapon Skill: How good that unit is in cqc</li>
      <li> Leadership: this number determines how hard is to shock/scare/fatigue the unit</li>
      <li> Movement: how many cm/inches/squares/whatever it can move </li>
      <li> Actions: How many actions that unit can do in one turn</li>
  </ul>
  some units have other stats, but it usually depends from unit to unit. <br>
  The common soldier might Look like this: <br>
<pre>
Name: Common Italian soldier
|---+---+----+----+---+---+---|
| H | A | RS | MS | L | M | A |
|---+---+----+----+---+---+---|
| 2 | 0 |  2 |  5 | 3 | 6 | 2 |
|---+---+----+----+---+---+---|
equipment:
|----------------+-------+-------+--------+---------+-------------+-----------|
| weapon         | type  | range | damage | bullets | penetration | abilities |
|----------------+-------+-------+--------+---------+-------------+-----------|
| Carcano Mod 91 | Rifle |    16 |      1 |       6 |           1 | none      |
|----------------+-------+-------+--------+---------+-------------+-----------|
- 6 rifle magazines (6 bullets per cartrige)
|---------+------+--------+-
| actions | move | reload |
|---------+------+--------+-
</pre>
as you can see it's quite basic; you have your unit, and you have a weapon. <br>
to shoot with the rifle you roll off a d6 for Ranged Skill; if you score more than the number, you can shoot <br>
let's break down the propeties of a weapon:
<ul>
    <li>Weapon: just the weapon name </li>
    <li>Type: The weapon type; every type has a positive and negative </li>
    <li>range: same for movement; basically the range in which an enemy must be to target it with that weapon</li>
    <li>Damage: how many wounds it deals per shot</li>
    <li>Bullets: the max bullet that weapon can have loaded; you just put a dice beside the model, and each time you shoot, you reorient the dice properly</li>
    <li> Penetration: how much is the weapon effective against armors</li>
    <li> ablities: this can be either some keywords or just an ability specific to the weapon itself.</li>
<ul>

let's make another example with a more complex weapon:
<pre>
|-------------+--------+-------+--------+---------+-------------+-----------+
| weapon      | type   | range | damage | bullets | penetration | abilities |
|-------------+--------+-------+--------+---------+-------------+-----------+
| Ã¹berflammer | Flamer |     8 |      6 | x       |           5 | eldritch  |
|-------------+--------+-------+--------+---------+-------------+-----------+
Special Ability: if the holder has an object with [Germany] and [Old ones] keywords, it deals 8 damage and penetrates 7.

as you can see it has a keyword, then an ability special to itself: the Flamer weapon has always the [Hazardous] keyword, so it's excluded, but it has the [eldritch] keyword; which is better explained in a table.
