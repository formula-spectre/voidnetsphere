<h1> World war 102: Entire Worlds at War </h1>

<i>Do you think Satan or God is afraid of the Old Ones?</i> <br>

World War 102, or originally known as World War Armageddon, was (is? idk) a setting that I made up to play with some friends.
it started out as a way to have an excuse to have WW2 minis and warhammer 40k/AoS minis battling eachother, then it devolved into a satirical parody of 40k 9th edition, and then it slowly mutated in an homebrew rule system based on warhammer 7th edition, konflikt '47, OPR and homebrew rules. The setting mutated with the game, at first it was the bare minimun to justify, then I added some more lore until it became what is it now.
we originally called it Word War Armageddon of super death because it was meant as a dumb brain-emptying game, but slowly we started to shorten it in World War Armageddon.
due the nature of the "birth" of the game the setting is satirical and grimdark (and grimdank too), and has many quirks.
